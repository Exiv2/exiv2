# Exiv2 Sample Applications

Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata.  Exiv2 also features a collection of sample and test command-line programs.  Please be aware that while the program _**exiv2**_ enjoys full support from Team Exiv2, the other programs have been written for test, documentation or development purposes.  You are expected to read the code to discover the specification of programs other than _**exiv2**_.

<div id="exifprint">

#### exifprint

```
Usage: exifprint [ file | --version | --version-test ]
```

| Arguments | Description |
|:--        |:---  |
| file    | Path to image |
| --version     | Print version information from build |
| --version-test   | Tests Exiv2 VERSION API |

This program demonstrates how to print _**Exif**_ metadata in an image.  This program is also discussed in the platform ReadMe.txt file included in a build bundle.  The option **--version** was added enable the user to build a test application which dumps the build information.  The option **--version-test** was added to test the macro EXIV2\_TEST\_VERSION() in **include/exiv2/version.hpp**.

There is one other unique feature of this program.  It is the only test/sample program which can use the EXV\_UNICODE\_PATH build feature of Exiv2 on Windows.

Usage: exifvalue file tag
```
Prints the value of a single _**Exif**_ tag in a file. _Code: [exifvalue.cpp](samples/exifvalue.cpp)_

[Sample](#TOC1) Programs [Test](#TOC2) Programs

<div id="exiv2json">

#### exiv2json

```
Usage: exiv2json [-option] file
Option: all | exif | iptc | xmp | filesystem
```
| Arguments | Description |
|:--        |:---  |
| all      | All metadata |
| filesystem    | Filesystem metadata |
| exif     | Exif metadata |
| iptc     | Iptc metadata |
| xmp      | Xmp metadata |
| file   | path to image |

This program dumps metadata from an image in JSON format. _Code: [exiv2json.cpp](samples/exiv2json.cpp)_

exiv2json has a recursive parser to encode XMP into Vectors and Objects.  XMP data is XMP and can contain XMP `Bag` and `Seq` which are converted to JSON Objects and Arrays.  Exiv2 presents data in the format:  Family.Group.Tag.  For XMP, results in "flat" output such such as:

```
$ exiv2 -px ~/Stonehenge.jpg
Xmp.xmp.Rating                               XmpText     1  0
Xmp.xmp.ModifyDate                           XmpText    25  2015-07-16T20:25:28+01:00
Xmp.dc.description                           LangAlt     1  lang="x-default" Classic View
```

exiv2json parses the Exiv2 'Family.Group.Tag' data and restores the structure of the original data in JSON.  _Code: [exiv2json.cpp](samples/exiv2json.cpp)_

```
$ exiv2json -xmp http://clanmills.com/Stonehenge.jpg
{
  "Xmp": {
    "xmp": {
      "Rating": "0",
      "ModifyDate": "2015-07-16T20:25:28+01:00"
    },
    "dc": {
      "description": {
        "lang": {
          "x-default": "Classic View"
        }
      }
    },
    "xmlns": {
      "dc": "http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/",
      "xmp": "http:\/\/ns.adobe.com\/xap\/1.0\/"
    }
  }
}
$
```

[Sample](#TOC1) Programs [Test](#TOC2) Programs

<div id="geotag">

#### geotag

```
Usage: geotag {-help|-version|-dst|-dryrun|-ascii|-verbose|-adjust value|-tz value|-delta value}+ path+
```

Geotag reads one or more GPX files and adds GPS Tages to images.  _Code: [geotag.cpp](samples/geotag.cpp)_

If the path is a directory, geotag will read all the files in the directory.  It constructs a time dictionary of position data, then updates every image with GPS Tags.

| Arguments | Description |
|:--        |:---  |
| -ascii    | Output in ascii (not UTF8).  Prints `deg` instead of &deg;. |
| -dst      | Apply 1 hour adjustment for daylight saving time. |
| -dryrun   | Read arguments and print report.  Does not modify images. |
| -verbose  | Report progress. |
| -adjust  value | Add/subtract time from image data. |
| -tz      value | Specify time zone. For example PST = -8:00 |
| -delta   value | Correction between Image DataTime and GPS time. |

I use this program frequently.  I have a little Canon camera which I take when I run.  My Samsung Galaxy Watch uploads my runs to Strava and I download the GPX.  If I'm in another time-zone and have forgotten to change the time setting in the camera, I use `-adjust` to alter the images.  The GPX time is always correct, however the camera is normally off by seconds or minutes.  This option enables you to correct for inaccuracy in the setting of the camera time.

This program is used to test the function **getopt()**.  Prior to Exiv2 v0.27, the sample programs used the platform's C Runtime Library function **getopt()**.  Visual Studio builds used code in src/getopt.cpp.  Due to differences in the platform **getopt()**, the code in src/getopt.cpp was modified and adopted on every platforms.  This test program was added for test and debug purpose.  Please note that src/getopt.cpp is compiled and linked into the sample application and is not part of the Exiv2 library.

Print a simple comma separated list of tags defined in Exiv2

This program encodes the library's tag definitions in ascii.
The data from this program is formatted as HTML on the web-site.  https://exiv2.org/metadata.html

For example, to show the binary definition of Group `Nikon3`:

```
1516 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/gnu/github/exiv2/0.27-maintenance $ taglist Nikon3
Version,    1,  0x0001, Nikon3, Exif.Nikon3.Version,    Undefined,  Nikon Makernote version
