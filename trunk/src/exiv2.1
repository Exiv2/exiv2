.TE
.IP \(bu 2
Support for GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height and width of the
image are determined.
.IP \(bu 2
Reading other TIFF-like RAW image formats, which are not listed in the
table, may also work.
.SH ACTIONS
The \fIaction\fP argument is only required if it is not clear from the
\fIoptions\fP which action is implied.
.TP
.B pr | print
Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the command
\fIexiv2 image.jpg\fP will print a summary of the image Exif metadata.
.TP
.B ex | extract
Extract metadata to *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail image files. 
Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.
.TP
.B in | insert
Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and
thumbnail files.  Use option \fB\-S\fP \fI.suf\fP to change the suffix
of the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used as
input files, this command can be used to copy the metadata between
files of different formats. Modification commands can be applied
on-the-fly.
.TP
.B rm | delete
Delete image metadata from the files.
.TP
.B ad | adjust
Adjust Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one of the
options \fB\-a\fP \fItime\fP, \fB\-Y\fP \fIyrs\fP, \fB\-O\fP
\fImon\fP or \fB\-D\fP \fIday\fP.
.TP
.B mo | modify
Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif, IPTC and XMP
metadata of image files. Requires option \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-m\fP or
\fB\-M\fP.
.TP
.B mv | rename
Rename files and/or set file timestamps according to the Exif create
timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal or, if
not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the timestamp. The
filename format can be set with \fB\-r\fP \fIfmt\fP, timestamp options
are \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-T\fP.
.TP
.B fi | fixiso
Copy the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
makernote ISO tags to the regular Exif ISO tag,
Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing standard
Exif ISO tag.
.TP
.B fc | fixcom
Fix the character encoding of Exif Unicode user comments.  Decodes the
comment using the auto-detected or specified character encoding and
writes it back in UCS-2. Use option \fB\-n\fP to specify the current
encoding of the comment if necessary.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Display help and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the program version and exit.
.br
When \fB\-V\fP is combined with \fB\-v\fP (Verbose version), build information
is printed to standard output along with a list of shared libraries which
have been loaded into memory. Verbose version is supported on Windows
(both MSVC and Cygwin builds), MacOSX and Linux and is provided
for test and debugging.
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose during the program run.
.TP
.B \-q
Silence warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library during the
program run (quiet). Note that options \fB\-v\fP and \fB\-q\fP can be
used at the same time.
.TP
.B \-Q \fIlvl\fP
Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
or 'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. \fB\-Qm\fP is equivalent
to \fB\-q\fP. All log messages are written to standard error.
.TP
.B \-b
Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).
.TP
.B \-u
Show unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't have a name).
.TP

Only output info for this Exiv2 key (grep). Multiple \fB\-g\fP options
can be used to grep info for several keys.
.TP
.B \-n \fIenc\fP
Charset to use to decode Exif Unicode user comments. \fIenc\fP is
a name understood by \fBiconv_open\fP(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.
.TP
.B \-k
Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used with
all options which update files. The flag is ignored by read-only
options.
.TP

Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
addition to renaming the file (overrides \fB\-k\fP). This option is
only used with the 'rename' action.
.TP
.B \-T
Only set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp, do
not rename the file (overrides \fB\-k\fP). This option is only used
with the 'rename' action. Note: On Windows you may have to set the TZ
environment variable for this option to work correctly.
.TP
.B \-f
Do not prompt before overwriting existing files (force overwrite).
.TP
.B \-F
Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1' 
('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.
.TP
.B \-a \fItime\fP

used with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds one hour, 1:01 
adds one hour and one minute, \-0:00:30 subtracts 30 seconds.
.TP
.B \-Y \fIyrs\fP
Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of years, for
the 'adjust' action.

list of preview image numbers is used to determine which preview images
to extract. The available preview images and their numbers are displayed
with the 'print' option \fB\-pp\fP.
.br

can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify
metadata on-the-fly.
.TP
.B \-m \fIfile\fP
Command file for the 'modify' action. This option can also be used
with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata on-the-fly.
.TP
.B \-M \fIcmd\fP
Command line for the 'modify' action. This option can also be used
with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata on-the-fly.
The format for the commands is the same as that of the lines of a

.TP
.B \-l \fIdir\fP
Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.
.TP
.B \-S \fI.suf\fP
Use suffix \fI.suf\fP for source files in 'insert' action.
.SH COMMANDS
Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g., 
.sp 1
.nf
   exiv2 \-m cmd.txt image.jpg
.fi
.sp 1
or given on the command line, as in
.sp 1
.nf
   exiv2 \-M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg
.fi
.sp 1
Note the quotes. Multiple \fB\-m\fP and \fB\-M\fP options can be combined.
.sp 1
When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, 
.B exiv2 
enforces only a correct
metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and values
different from those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While 
.B exiv2 
is able to read
all metadata that it can write, other programs may have difficulties
with images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.
.SS Command format
The format of a command is
.sp 1
.nf
\fBset | add | del\fP \fIkey\fP [[\fItype\fP] \fIvalue\fP]
.fi
.TP
.B set
Set the \fIvalue\fP of an existing tag with a matching \fIkey\fP or
add the tag.
.TP
.B add
Add a tag (unless \fIkey\fP is a non\-repeatable IPTC key; nothing
prevents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).
.TP
.B del
Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a \fIkey\fP).
.TP
.I key
Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.
.TP
.I type
.B Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined | SShort | SLong | SRational | Comment
for Exif keys,
.br
.B String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined
for IPTC keys, and
.br
.B XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt
for XMP keys.
.sp 1
A default \fItype\fP is used if none is explicitly given. The default
is determined based on \fIkey\fP.
.TP
.I value
The remaining text on the line is the value. It can optionally be
enclosed in single quotes ('\fIvalue\fP') or double quotes ("\fIvalue\fP").
.sp 1
The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent to an
empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array property,
e.g., a bag.
.sp 1
The format of Exif \fBComment\fP values includes an optional charset
specification at the beginning:
.sp 1
.B   [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]\fIcomment\fP
.sp 1
.B Undefined 
is used by default if the value doesn't start with a charset
definition.
.sp 1
The format for IPTC \fBDate\fP values is YYYY\-MM\-DD (year, month, day),
that for IPTC \fBTime\fP values is HH:MM:SS+|\-HH:MM, where HH:MM:SS
refers to local hour, minute and seconds and +|\-HH:MM refers to hours
and minutes ahead or behind Universal Coordinated Time (+|\- means
either a + or a \- sign is required).
.sp 1
The format of XMP \fBLangAlt\fP values includes an optional language
qualifier:
.sp 1
.B   [lang=\fIlanguage-code\fP ]\fItext\fP
.sp 1
.B x-default
is used by default if the value doesn't start with a language qualifier.
.TP
An additional command is available to register XMP namespaces:
.TP
.nf
\fBreg\fP \fIprefix\fP \fInamespace\fP
.fi
.SS Command file format
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fP in a command file are
ignored (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.
.TP
exiv2 \-iixX image.jpg
Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp into
image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted from the "IPTC
Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the older IPTC IIM4
format. The inserted XMP properties include those in the "IPTC Core"
XMP schema.
.TP
.nf
exiv2 \-M"set Exif.Photo.UserComment charset=Ascii New Exif comment" image.jpg
.fi
Sets the Exif comment to an ASCII string.
.TP
.nf
exiv2 \-M"set Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude 4/1 15/1 33/1" \\
\-M"set Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
.fi
Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north. The
Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude tag consists of three
Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds of the latitude
and GPSLatitudeRef contains either 'N' or 'S' for north or south
latitude respectively.
.TP
.nf
exiv2 insert \-l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
.fi
Copy all metadata from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG files
with corresponding basenames in the /data directory. Note that this
copies metadata as is, without any modifications to adapt it to the
requirements of the target format. Some tags copied like this may not
make sense in the target image.
