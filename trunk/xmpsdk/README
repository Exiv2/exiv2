XMP Toolkit
***********

Exiv2 uses the XMPCore component of the Adobe XMP Toolkit (XMP SDK) to
parse and serialize XMP packets. Temporarily, it is integrated and
distributed together with Exiv2. The xmpsdk/ directory of the Exiv2
distribution (this directory) contains the XMP SDK source code. The
final solution will rely on an external XMP Toolkit, once it is
available as a standalone package from Linux distros.

Building the XMP Toolkit is transparent. Following the installation
steps described in the top-level Exiv2 README file will ensure that
the XMP Toolkit is compiled if necessary. It is only needed if XMP
support is enabled. Building the XMP Toolkit results in a static
library xmpsdk/lib/libxmpsdk.a. This library is not installed on the
system and is not meant to be used as a standalone library. It is
only used to build Exiv2.

If you experience problems building this library, please email to the
Exiv2 support forum for help, see http://www.exiv2.org/support.html
and not to Adobe directly.
