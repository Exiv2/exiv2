XMP support
***********

XMP support is controlled with the --enable-xmp and --disable-xmp
options to the configure script. Building Exiv2 with XMP support
requires the Expat XML parser library (http://expat.sourceforge.net/).
The --with-expat configure option can be used if it is installed in a
non-standard directory.

For API documentation of XMP classes and samples, build or install the 
documentation and go to doc/html/getting-started.html

XMP Toolkit
===========

Exiv2 uses the XMPCore component of the Adobe XMP Toolkit (XMP SDK) to
parse and serialize XMP packets. Temporarily, it is integrated and
distributed with Exiv2. The xmpsdk/ directory of the Exiv2 distribution
contains the XMP SDK source code. The final solution will eventually
use an external XMP Toolkit.

Building the XMP Toolkit is transparent. Following the installation
steps described in the main README file will ensure that the XMP
Toolkit is compiled if necessary. It is only needed if XMP support is
enabled. Building the XMP Toolkit results in a "convenience library"
in xmpsdk/src/. This library is only used to link the Exiv2 library 
with.

If you experience problems building this library, please email to the
Exiv2 support forum for help, see http://www.exiv2.org/support.html
and not to Adobe directly.
