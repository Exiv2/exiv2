XMP support
===========
Exiv2 uses the Adobe XMP toolkit (XMP SDK) to parse
and serialize XMP packets (only the XMPCore component).

Todo: XMP support is controlled with the ENABLE_XMP directive 
in config/config.mk.in. This will be a configure option
eventually.

Top-level classes to access XMP metadata are XmpData,
XmpDatum and XmpKey. They work similar to the corresponding 
Exif and IPTC classes. The property-repository is XmpProperties.
In addition to the expected new members, class Image also
has a new interface to access the raw XMP packet.

Supported XMP types
-------------------
Simple types : supported
Structures   : not supported
Arrays       : unordered and ordered arrays are supported
               alternative arrays are not supported

Property Qualifiers : not supported
Language Alternatives : not supported

XMP properties are accessed through keys of the form
"Xmp.<Prefix>.<Property>", where <Prefix> is the preferred
(or rather, registered) prefix for a schema namespace and
<Property> is the name of a property in that namespace. Only 
known properties in known namespaces are supported at the
moment. Functions to register namespaces and properterties
are not provided yet.

Note: Unlike Exif and IPTC tags, XMP properties do not have
a tag number.

XMP toolkit installation
========================
This is what worked for me on a Debian GNU/Linux (testing) 
system. Your mileage may vary. Please check with Adobe if 
you encounter problems with the XMP toolkit installation.

Installation directory
----------------------
The top-level exiv2 directory ($HOME/src/exiv2/ on my system).

If you install XMP elsewhere, or use different OS or STAGE
options to the make command below, you will need to manually
modify the exiv2/config/config.mk.in (before running the 
configure script). There is no autoconf-magic yet to set 
this via configure options.

External packages (non-Debian)
-----------------
xmp_v411_sdk.zip    - from adobe.com:       http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/sdk/eula.html
expat-2.0.1.tar.gz  - from sourceforge.net: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10127
exiv2               - from SVN

Installation steps
------------------
cd $HOME/src/exiv2/
cp /path/to/xmp_v411_sdk.zip ./
unzip xmp_v411_sdk.zip

cp /path/to/expat-2.0.1.tar.gz XMP-SDK/third-party/
cd XMP-SDK/third-party/
tar zxvf expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
mv expat expat-orig
mv expat-2.0.1 expat

cd ../build/gcc
make -f XMPCore.mak OS=i80386linux STAGE=debug

Expected result
---------------
Now there should be a library
../../public/libraries/i80386linux/debug/libXMPCoreStaticDebug.a
