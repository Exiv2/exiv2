* enable build types in cmake. In case required, add support for it

* Added cmake target to build/install doc.

* Added Cmake target to release build and packaging.

* The following options of the configure script should be supported
   --without-zlib       DONE - ENABLE_PNG
   --disable-nls        DONE - ENABLE_NLS ??? that doesn't work correctly here
   --disable-printucs2  DONE - ENABLE_PRINTUCS2
   --disable-xmp        DONE - ENABLE_XMP
   --enable-commercial  DONE - ENABLE_COMMERCIAL
   --disable-lensdata   DONE - ENABLE_LENSDATA
   --disable-shared     DONE - ENABLE_SHARED_EXIV2

* add support for cross-compiling : add information on how to cross-compile on Linux for Windows (MinGW)
 (some applications and my own release-build process need this) to the README.CMAKE

* Can the logic needed to build the doc be re-written using cmake?

* Manage i18n extraction to generate .po files. (See how KDE project manage it with script ?)

* Rename configuration settings to EXIV2_*, e.g., EXIV2_ENABLE_SHARED

* Two cmake projects: 1) exiv2 2) samples, common config in config/

* emacs M-c command to (re-)compile

* added cmake target to uninstall Exiv2. On UNIX-like systems, use "$ xargs rm < install_manifest.txt"

* migrate the whole README-CMAKE to README.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE * Is it possible to not have CMakeLists.txt file in the top dir?
   => No. I Never see this in whole KDE project.

DONE * Need soname versioning for shared library.

DONE * Add further messages to display option settings.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   -- Exiv2 0.18-pre1 feature configuration summary
   --
   -- Build a shared library......... NO
   -- PNG image support.............. YES
   -- Native language support........ NO

   gettext is required for native language support. Make sure the
   gettext header files are installed. You can get gettext from
   http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

   -- Conversion of Windows XP tags.. YES
   -- Nikon lens database............ YES
   -- XMP metadata support........... YES
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE * add possibility to build xmp as a convenience library.

DONE * Compilation fails if Expat (possibly also other dependencies?) is in a non-standard place.

WONTFIX * This is probably not necessary in src/CMakeLists.txt / can be removed:
   set( LIBEXIV2_SRC   ${LIBEXIV2_SRC} getopt_win32.c )
   it is necessary as both windows compilers do not autoexport

DONE * Do we need to worry about MSVC warnings like this:
   d:\home\ahuggel\msys\src\exiv2\src\exif.hpp(245) : warning C4251: 'Exiv2::Exifdatum::value_' : class 'std::auto_ptr<_Ty>'
   needs to have dll-interface to be used by clients of class 'Exiv2::Exifdatum'
   with
   [
       _Ty=Exiv2::Value
   ]

DONE * Is the pkgconfig file not installed in MinGW? - it is now.

DONE * Added targets to build/install man page.

DONE * Need g++ specific : compiler options (warnings) and settings (visibility).

DONE * Manage eviv2.pc file with CMake, like it's do with kdegraphics/libs .pc file. Look there for details:
   http://lxr.kde.org/source/KDE/kdegraphics/libs/libkexiv2/CMakeLists.txt#59
   http://lxr.kde.org/source/KDE/kdegraphics/libs/libkexiv2/libkexiv2.pc.cmake

INFO * check How does cmake handle RPATH? (I'll read up on this).
