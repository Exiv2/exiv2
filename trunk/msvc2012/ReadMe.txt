The build environment for Visual Studio 2012 is basically the same
as msvc2005 and you should consult msvc2005\ReadMe.txt for information
about the build.

The Visual Studio 2012 project file convertor created this new build environment
however the build failed for several of the Release and Debug (static) applications.

The project files in msvc2012 have been hand modified to successfully build
exiv2 and all the sample applications.  The environment can build 32bit and 64bit
binaries in four flavors:

    Debug and Release       (static)
    DebugDLL and ReleaseDLL (shared libraries)
    
The static builds are linked with the static C-runtime libraries.
The shared builds are linked with the shared C-runtime libraries.
