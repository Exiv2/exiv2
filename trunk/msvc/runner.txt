PrintImageMatching,	50341,	0xc4a5,	Image,	Exif.Image.PrintImageMatching,	Undefined,	Print Image Matching, description needed.
DNGVersion,	50706,	0xc612,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGVersion,	Byte,	This tag encodes the DNG four-tier version number. For files compliant with version 1.1.0.0 of the DNG specification, this tag should contain the bytes: 1, 1, 0, 0.
DNGBackwardVersion,	50707,	0xc613,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGBackwardVersion,	Byte,	This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers shouldnot attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on.  In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.
UniqueCameraModel,	50708,	0xc614,	Image,	Exif.Image.UniqueCameraModel,	Ascii,	Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles.
LocalizedCameraModel,	50709,	0xc615,	Image,	Exif.Image.LocalizedCameraModel,	Byte,	Similar to the UniqueCameraModel field, except the name can be localized for different markets to match the localization of the camera name.
CFAPlaneColor,	50710,	0xc616,	Image,	Exif.Image.CFAPlaneColor,	Byte,	Provides a mapping between the values in the CFAPattern tag and the plane numbers in LinearRaw space. This is a required tag for non-RGB CFA images.
CFALayout,	50711,	0xc617,	Image,	Exif.Image.CFALayout,	Short,	Describes the spatial layout of the CFA.
LinearizationTable,	50712,	0xc618,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearizationTable,	Short,	Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelRepeatDim,	50713,	0xc619,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim,	Short,	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
BlackLevel,	50714,	0xc61a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevel,	Rational,	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern. The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle. The values are stored in row-column-sample scan order.
BlackLevelDeltaH,	50715,	0xc61b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaH,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, BlackLevelDeltaH specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelDeltaV,	50716,	0xc61c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaV,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image row, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
WhiteLevel,	50717,	0xc61d,	Image,	Exif.Image.WhiteLevel,	Short,	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
DefaultScale,	50718,	0xc61e,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultScale,	Rational,	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
DefaultCropOrigin,	50719,	0xc61f,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
DNGPrivateData,	50740,	0xc634,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,	Byte,	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
MakerNoteSafety,	50741,	0xc635,	Image,	Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety,	Short,	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
CalibrationIlluminant1,	50778,	0xc65a,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,	Short,	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
CalibrationIlluminant2,	50779,	0xc65b,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,	Short,	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
BestQualityScale,	50780,	0xc65c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,	Rational,	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
RawDataUniqueID,	50781,	0xc65d,	Image,	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,	Byte,	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
ActiveArea,	50829,	0xc68d,	Image,	Exif.Image.ActiveArea,	Short,	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
MaskedAreas,	50830,	0xc68e,	Image,	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,	Short,	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
ExposureTime,	33434,	0x829a,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ExposureTime,	Rational,	Exposure time, given in seconds (sec).
FNumber,	33437,	0x829d,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.FNumber,	Rational,	The F number.

ISOSpeedRatings,	34855,	0x8827,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings,	Short,	Indicates the ISO Speed and ISO Latitude of the camera or input device as specified in ISO 12232.
OECF,	34856,	0x8828,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.OECF,	Undefined,	Indicates the Opto-Electoric Conversion Function (OECF) specified in ISO 14524. <OECF> is the relationship between the camera optical input and the image values.
ExifVersion,	36864,	0x9000,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ExifVersion,	Undefined,	The version of this standard supported. Nonexistence of this field is taken to mean nonconformance to the standard.
DateTimeOriginal,	36867,	0x9003,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal,	Ascii,	The date and time when the original image data was generated. For a digital still camera the date and time the picture was taken are recorded.
DateTimeDigitized,	36868,	0x9004,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized,	Ascii,	The date and time when the image was stored as digital data.
ComponentsConfiguration,	37121,	0x9101,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ComponentsConfiguration,	Undefined,	Information specific to compressed data. The channels of each component are arranged in order from the 1st component to the 4th. For uncompressed data the data arrangement is given in the <PhotometricInterpretation> tag. However, since <PhotometricInterpretation> can only express the order of Y, Cb and Cr, this tag is provided for cases when compressed data uses components other than Y, Cb, and Cr and to enable support of other sequences.
CompressedBitsPerPixel,	37122,	0x9102,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.CompressedBitsPerPixel,	Rational,	Information specific to compressed data. The compression mode used for a compressed image is indicated in unit bits per pixel.

MaxApertureValue,	37381,	0x9205,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue,	Rational,	The smallest F number of the lens. The unit is the APEX value. Ordinarily it is given in the range of 00.00 to 99.99, but it is not limited to this range.
SubjectDistance,	37382,	0x9206,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.SubjectDistance,	Rational,	The distance to the subject, given in meters.
MeteringMode,	37383,	0x9207,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.MeteringMode,	Short,	The metering mode.

Flash,	37385,	0x9209,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.Flash,	Short,	This tag is recorded when an image is taken using a strobe light (flash).
FocalLength,	37386,	0x920a,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.FocalLength,	Rational,	The actual focal length of the lens, in mm. Conversion is not made to the focal length of a 35 mm film camera.

UserComment,	37510,	0x9286,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.UserComment,	Comment,	A tag for Exif users to write keywords or comments on the image besides those in <ImageDescription>, and without the character code limitations of the <ImageDescription> tag.
SubSecTime,	37520,	0x9290,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.SubSecTime,	Ascii,	A tag used to record fractions of seconds for the <DateTime> tag.
SubSecTimeOriginal,	37521,	0x9291,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.SubSecTimeOriginal,	Ascii,	A tag used to record fractions of seconds for the <DateTimeOriginal> tag.
SubSecTimeDigitized,	37522,	0x9292,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.SubSecTimeDigitized,	Ascii,	A tag used to record fractions of seconds for the <DateTimeDigitized> tag.
FlashpixVersion,	40960,	0xa000,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.FlashpixVersion,	Undefined,	The FlashPix format version supported by a FPXR file.
ColorSpace,	40961,	0xa001,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ColorSpace,	Short,	The color space information tag is always recorded as the color space specifier. Normally sRGB is used to define the color space based on the PC monitor conditions and environment. If a color space other than sRGB is used, Uncalibrated is set. Image data recorded as Uncalibrated can be treated as sRGB when it is converted to FlashPix.
PixelXDimension,	40962,	0xa002,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.PixelXDimension,	Long,	Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid width of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file.
PixelYDimension,	40963,	0xa003,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.PixelYDimension,	Long,	Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid height of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file. Since data padding is unnecessary in the vertical direction, the number of lines recorded in this valid image height tag will in fact be the same as that recorded in the SOF.
RelatedSoundFile,	40964,	0xa004,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.RelatedSoundFile,	Ascii,	This tag is used to record the name of an audio file related to the image data. The only relational information recorded here is the Exif audio file name and extension (an ASCII string consisting of 8 characters + '.' + 3 characters). The path is not recorded.
InteroperabilityTag,	40965,	0xa005,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.InteroperabilityTag,	Long,	Interoperability IFD is composed of tags which stores the information to ensure the Interoperability and pointed by the following tag located in Exif IFD. The Interoperability structure of Interoperability IFD is the same as TIFF defined IFD structure but does not contain the image data characteristically compared with normal TIFF IFD.

DNGVersion,	50706,	0xc612,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGVersion,	Byte,	This tag encodes the DNG four-tier version number. For files compliant with version 1.1.0.0 of the DNG specification, this tag should contain the bytes: 1, 1, 0, 0.
DNGBackwardVersion,	50707,	0xc613,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGBackwardVersion,	Byte,	This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers shouldnot attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on.  In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.
UniqueCameraModel,	50708,	0xc614,	Image,	Exif.Image.UniqueCameraModel,	Ascii,	Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles.
LocalizedCameraModel,	50709,	0xc615,	Image,	Exif.Image.LocalizedCameraModel,	Byte,	Similar to the UniqueCameraModel field, except the name can be localized for different markets to match the localization of the camera name.
CFAPlaneColor,	50710,	0xc616,	Image,	Exif.Image.CFAPlaneColor,	Byte,	Provides a mapping between the values in the CFAPattern tag and the plane numbers in LinearRaw space. This is a required tag for non-RGB CFA images.
CFALayout,	50711,	0xc617,	Image,	Exif.Image.CFALayout,	Short,	Describes the spatial layout of the CFA.
LinearizationTable,	50712,	0xc618,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearizationTable,	Short,	Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelRepeatDim,	50713,	0xc619,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim,	Short,	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
BlackLevel,	50714,	0xc61a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevel,	Rational,	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern. The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle. The values are stored in row-column-sample scan order.
BlackLevelDeltaH,	50715,	0xc61b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaH,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, BlackLevelDeltaH specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelDeltaV,	50716,	0xc61c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaV,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image row, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
WhiteLevel,	50717,	0xc61d,	Image,	Exif.Image.WhiteLevel,	Short,	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
DefaultScale,	50718,	0xc61e,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultScale,	Rational,	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
DefaultCropOrigin,	50719,	0xc61f,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
DNGPrivateData,	50740,	0xc634,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,	Byte,	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
MakerNoteSafety,	50741,	0xc635,	Image,	Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety,	Short,	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
CalibrationIlluminant1,	50778,	0xc65a,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,	Short,	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
CalibrationIlluminant2,	50779,	0xc65b,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,	Short,	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
BestQualityScale,	50780,	0xc65c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,	Rational,	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
RawDataUniqueID,	50781,	0xc65d,	Image,	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,	Byte,	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
ActiveArea,	50829,	0xc68d,	Image,	Exif.Image.ActiveArea,	Short,	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
MaskedAreas,	50830,	0xc68e,	Image,	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,	Short,	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
ExposureTime,	33434,	0x829a,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ExposureTime,	Rational,	Exposure time, given in seconds (sec).
FNumber,	33437,	0x829d,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.FNumber,	Rational,	The F number.
ExposureProgram,	34850,	0x8822,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ExposureProgram,	Short,	The class of the program used by the camera to set exposure when the picture is taken.
SpectralSensitivity,	34852,	0x8824,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.SpectralSensitivity,	Ascii,	Indicates the spectral sensitivity of each channel of the camera used. The tag value is an ASCII string compatible with the standard developed by the ASTM Technical Committee.

BlackLevelRepeatDim,	50713,	0xc619,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim,	Short,	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
BlackLevel,	50714,	0xc61a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevel,	Rational,	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern.

If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
WhiteLevel,	50717,	0xc61d,	Image,	Exif.Image.WhiteLevel,	Short,	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
DefaultScale,	50718,	0xc61e,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultScale,	Rational,	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
DefaultCropOrigin,	50719,	0xc61f,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image.

DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.

OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.

The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.

These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
DNGPrivateData,	50740,	0xc634,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,	Byte,	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
MakerNoteSafety,	50741,	0xc635,	Image,	Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety,	Short,	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
CalibrationIlluminant1,	50778,	0xc65a,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,	Short,	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
CalibrationIlluminant2,	50779,	0xc65b,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,	Short,	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
BestQualityScale,	50780,	0xc65c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,	Rational,	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
RawDataUniqueID,	50781,	0xc65d,	Image,	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,	Byte,	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
ActiveArea,	50829,	0xc68d,	Image,	Exif.Image.ActiveArea,	Short,	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
MaskedAreas,	50830,	0xc68e,	Image,	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,	Short,	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.

ComponentsConfiguration,	37121,	0x9101,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ComponentsConfiguration,	Undefined,	Information specific to compressed data. The channels of each component are arranged in order from the 1st component to the 4th. For uncompressed data the data arrangement is given in the <PhotometricInterpretation> tag. However, since <PhotometricInterpretation> can only express the order of Y, Cb and Cr, this tag is provided for cases when compressed data uses components other than Y, Cb, and Cr and to enable support of other sequences.

ColorSpace,	40961,	0xa001,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ColorSpace,	Short,	The color space information tag is always recorded as the color space specifier. Normally sRGB is used to define the color space based on the PC monitor conditions and environment. If a color space other than sRGB is used, Uncalibrated is set. Image data recorded as Uncalibrated can be treated as sRGB when it is converted to FlashPix.
PixelXDimension,	40962,	0xa002,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.PixelXDimension,	Long,	Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid width of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file.
PixelYDimension,	40963,	0xa003,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.PixelYDimension,	Long,	Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid height of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file. Since data padding is unnecessary in the vertical direction, the number of lines recorded in this valid image height tag will in fact be the same as that recorded in the SOF.
RelatedSoundFile,	40964,	0xa004,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.RelatedSoundFile,	Ascii,	This tag is used to record the name of an audio file related to the image data. The only relational information recorded here is the Exif audio file name and extension (an ASCII string consisting of 8 characters + '.' + 3 characters). The path is not recorded.

DNGBackwardVersion,	50707,	0xc613,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGBackwardVersion,	Byte,	This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers shouldnot attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on.  In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.
UniqueCameraModel,	50708,	0xc614,	Image,	Exif.Image.UniqueCameraModel,	Ascii,	Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel).

LinearizationTable,	50712,	0xc618,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearizationTable,	Short,	Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelRepeatDim,	50713,	0xc619,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim,	Short,	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
BlackLevel,	50714,	0xc61a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevel,	Rational,	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern.

If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
WhiteLevel,	50717,	0xc61d,	Image,	Exif.Image.WhiteLevel,	Short,	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
DefaultScale,	50718,	0xc61e,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultScale,	Rational,	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
DefaultCropOrigin,	50719,	0xc61f,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
DNGPrivateData,	50740,	0xc634,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,	Byte,	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.

LinearizationTable,	50712,	0xc618,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearizationTable,	Short,	Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelRepeatDim,	50713,	0xc619,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim,	Short,	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
BlackLevel,	50714,	0xc61a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevel,	Rational,	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern. The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle. The values are stored in row-column-sample scan order.
BlackLevelDeltaH,	50715,	0xc61b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaH,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, BlackLevelDeltaH specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelDeltaV,	50716,	0xc61c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaV,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image row, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
WhiteLevel,	50717,	0xc61d,	Image,	Exif.Image.WhiteLevel,	Short,	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
DefaultScale,	50718,	0xc61e,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultScale,	Rational,	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
DefaultCropOrigin,	50719,	0xc61f,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
DNGPrivateData,	50740,	0xc634,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,	Byte,	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
MakerNoteSafety,	50741,	0xc635,	Image,	Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety,	Short,	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
CalibrationIlluminant1,	50778,	0xc65a,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,	Short,	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
CalibrationIlluminant2,	50779,	0xc65b,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,	Short,	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
BestQualityScale,	50780,	0xc65c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,	Rational,	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
RawDataUniqueID,	50781,	0xc65d,	Image,	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,	Byte,	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
ActiveArea,	50829,	0xc68d,	Image,	Exif.Image.ActiveArea,	Short,	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
MaskedAreas,	50830,	0xc68e,	Image,	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,	Short,	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.

ComponentsConfiguration,	37121,	0x9101,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ComponentsConfiguration,	Undefined,	Information specific to compressed data. The channels of each component are arranged in order from the 1st component to the 4th. For uncompressed data the data arrangement is given in the <PhotometricInterpretation> tag. However, since <PhotometricInterpretation> can only express the order of Y, Cb and Cr, this tag is provided for cases when compressed data uses components other than Y, Cb, and Cr and to enable support of other sequences.
CompressedBitsPerPixel,	37122,	0x9102,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.CompressedBitsPerPixel,	Rational,	Information specific to compressed data. The compression mode used for a compressed image is indicated in unit bits per pixel.

FlashpixVersion,	40960,	0xa000,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.FlashpixVersion,	Undefined,	The FlashPix format version supported by a FPXR file.
ColorSpace,	40961,	0xa001,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ColorSpace,	Short,	The color space information tag is always recorded as the color space specifier. Normally sRGB is used to define the color space based on the PC monitor conditions and environment. If a color space other than sRGB is used, Uncalibrated is set. Image data recorded as Uncalibrated can be treated as sRGB when it is converted to FlashPix.
PixelXDimension,	40962,	0xa002,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.PixelXDimension,	Long,	Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid width of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file.
PixelYDimension,	40963,	0xa003,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.PixelYDimension,	Long,	Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid height of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file. Since data padding is unnecessary in the vertical direction, the number of lines recorded in this valid image height tag will in fact be the same as that recorded in the SOF.
RelatedSoundFile,	40964,	0xa004,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.RelatedSoundFile,	Ascii,	This tag is used to record the name of an audio file related to the image data. The only relational information recorded here is the Exif audio file name and extension (an ASCII string consisting of 8 characters + '.' + 3 characters). The path is not recorded.

The value of this tag represents the pixel at the center of the main subject relative to the left edge, prior to rotation processing as per the <Rotation> tag. The first value indicates the X column number and second indicates the Y row number.

It is the copyright notice of the person or organization claiming rights to the image. The Interoperability copyright statement including date and rights should be written in this field; e.g., "Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights reserved.". In this standard the field records both the photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright, separated by NULL (in this case since the statement also ends with a NULL, there are two NULL codes). When only the photographer copyright is given, it is terminated by one NULL code . When only the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then the editor copyright is given. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.

DNGVersion,	50706,	0xc612,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGVersion,	Byte,	This tag encodes the DNG four-tier version number. For files compliant with version 1.1.0.0 of the DNG specification, this tag should contain the bytes: 1, 1, 0, 0.
DNGBackwardVersion,	50707,	0xc613,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGBackwardVersion,	Byte,	This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers shouldnot attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on.  In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.
UniqueCameraModel,	50708,	0xc614,	Image,	Exif.Image.UniqueCameraModel,	Ascii,	Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles.
LocalizedCameraModel,	50709,	0xc615,	Image,	Exif.Image.LocalizedCameraModel,	Byte,	Similar to the UniqueCameraModel field, except the name can be localized for different markets to match the localization of the camera name.
CFAPlaneColor,	50710,	0xc616,	Image,	Exif.Image.CFAPlaneColor,	Byte,	Provides a mapping between the values in the CFAPattern tag and the plane numbers in LinearRaw space. This is a required tag for non-RGB CFA images.
CFALayout,	50711,	0xc617,	Image,	Exif.Image.CFALayout,	Short,	Describes the spatial layout of the CFA.
LinearizationTable,	50712,	0xc618,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearizationTable,	Short,	Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelRepeatDim,	50713,	0xc619,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim,	Short,	Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
BlackLevel,	50714,	0xc61a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevel,	Rational,	Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern. The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle. The values are stored in row-column-sample scan order.
BlackLevelDeltaH,	50715,	0xc61b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaH,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, BlackLevelDeltaH specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
BlackLevelDeltaV,	50716,	0xc61c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaV,	SRational,	If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image row, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
WhiteLevel,	50717,	0xc61d,	Image,	Exif.Image.WhiteLevel,	Short,	This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
DefaultScale,	50718,	0xc61e,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultScale,	Rational,	DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
DefaultCropOrigin,	50719,	0xc61f,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
DefaultCropSize,	50720,	0xc620,	Image,	Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize,	Short,	Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
ColorMatrix1,	50721,	0xc621,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1,	SRational,	ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
ColorMatrix2,	50722,	0xc622,	Image,	Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2,	SRational,	ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
CameraCalibration1,	50723,	0xc623,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1,	SRational,	CameraClalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
ReductionMatrix1,	50725,	0xc625,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
ReductionMatrix2,	50726,	0xc626,	Image,	Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2,	SRational,	ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
DNGPrivateData,	50740,	0xc634,	Image,	Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,	Byte,	Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
MakerNoteSafety,	50741,	0xc635,	Image,	Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety,	Short,	MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
CalibrationIlluminant1,	50778,	0xc65a,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,	Short,	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
CalibrationIlluminant2,	50779,	0xc65b,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,	Short,	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
BestQualityScale,	50780,	0xc65c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,	Rational,	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
RawDataUniqueID,	50781,	0xc65d,	Image,	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,	Byte,	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
ActiveArea,	50829,	0xc68d,	Image,	Exif.Image.ActiveArea,	Short,	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
MaskedAreas,	50830,	0xc68e,	Image,	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,	Short,	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
ExposureTime,	33434,	0x829a,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ExposureTime,	Rational,	Exposure time, given in seconds (sec).
FNumber,	33437,	0x829d,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.FNumber,	Rational,	The F number.

SpectralSensitivity,	34852,	0x8824,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.SpectralSensitivity,	Ascii,	Indicates the spectral sensitivity of each channel of the camera used. The tag value is an ASCII string compatible with the standard developed by the ASTM Technical Committee.
ISOSpeedRatings,	34855,	0x8827,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings,	Short,	Indicates the ISO Speed and ISO Latitude of the camera or input device as specified in ISO 12232.
OECF,	34856,	0x8828,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.OECF,	Undefined,	Indicates the Opto-Electoric Conversion Function (OECF) specified in ISO 14524. <OECF> is the relationship between the camera optical input and the image values.
ExifVersion,	36864,	0x9000,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ExifVersion,	Undefined,	The version of this standard supported. Nonexistence of this field is taken to mean nonconformance to the standard.
DateTimeOriginal,	36867,	0x9003,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal,	Ascii,	The date and time when the original image data was generated. For a digital still camera the date and time the picture was taken are recorded.
DateTimeDigitized,	36868,	0x9004,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized,	Ascii,	The date and time when the image was stored as digital data.
ComponentsConfiguration,	37121,	0x9101,	Photo,	Exif.Photo.ComponentsConfiguration,	Undefined,	Information specific to compressed data. The channels of each component are arranged in order from the 1st component to the 4th. For uncompressed data the data arrangement is given in the <PhotometricInterpretation> tag.

The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
CameraCalibration2,	50724,	0xc624,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2,	SRational,	CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.

This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
AnalogBalance,	50727,	0xc627,	Image,	Exif.Image.AnalogBalance,	Rational,	Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
AsShotNeutral,	50728,	0xc628,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral,	Short,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
AsShotWhiteXY,	50729,	0xc629,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY,	Rational,	Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
BaselineExposure,	50730,	0xc62a,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineExposure,	SRational,	Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
BaselineNoise,	50731,	0xc62b,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,	Rational,	Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
BaselineSharpness,	50732,	0xc62c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,	Rational,	Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
BayerGreenSplit,	50733,	0xc62d,	Image,	Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,	Long,	Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
LinearResponseLimit,	50734,	0xc62e,	Image,	Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,	Rational,	Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
CameraSerialNumber,	50735,	0xc62f,	Image,	Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,	Ascii,	CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
LensInfo,	50736,	0xc630,	Image,	Exif.Image.LensInfo,	Rational,	Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
ChromaBlurRadius,	50737,	0xc631,	Image,	Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,	Rational,	ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
AntiAliasStrength,	50738,	0xc632,	Image,	Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,	Rational,	Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
ShadowScale,	50739,	0xc633,	Image,	Exif.Image.ShadowScale,	SRational,	This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.

File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
CalibrationIlluminant1,	50778,	0xc65a,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,	Short,	The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag.
CalibrationIlluminant2,	50779,	0xc65b,	Image,	Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,	Short,	The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown).
BestQualityScale,	50780,	0xc65c,	Image,	Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,	Rational,	For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
RawDataUniqueID,	50781,	0xc65d,	Image,	Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,	Byte,	This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
OriginalRawFileName,	50827,	0xc68b,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,	Byte,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
OriginalRawFileData,	50828,	0xc68c,	Image,	Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,	Undefined,	If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
ActiveArea,	50829,	0xc68d,	Image,	Exif.Image.ActiveArea,	Short,	This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
MaskedAreas,	50830,	0xc68e,	Image,	Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,	Short,	This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
AsShotICCProfile,	50831,	0xc68f,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	50832,	0xc690,	Image,	Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
CurrentICCProfile,	50833,	0xc691,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,	Undefined,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	50834,	0xc692,	Image,	Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix,	SRational,	This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.

GPSDestLongitudeRef,	21,	0x0015,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSDestLongitudeRef,	Ascii,	Indicates whether the longitude of the destination point is east or west longitude. ASCII "E" indicates east longitude, and "W" is west longitude.
GPSDestLongitude,	22,	0x0016,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSDestLongitude,	Rational,	Indicates the longitude of the destination point. The longitude is expressed as three RATIONAL values giving the degrees, minutes, and seconds, respectively. If longitude is expressed as degrees, minutes and seconds, a typical format would be ddd/1,mm/1,ss/1. When degrees and minutes are used and, for example, fractions of minutes are given up to two decimal places, the format would be ddd/1,mmmm/100,0/1.
GPSDestBearingRef,	23,	0x0017,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSDestBearingRef,	Ascii,	Indicates the reference used for giving the bearing to the destination point. "T" denotes true direction and "M" is magnetic direction.
GPSDestBearing,	24,	0x0018,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSDestBearing,	Rational,	Indicates the bearing to the destination point. The range of values is from 0.00 to 359.99.
GPSDestDistanceRef,	25,	0x0019,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSDestDistanceRef,	Ascii,	Indicates the unit used to express the distance to the destination point. "K", "M" and "N" represent kilometers, miles and knots.
GPSDestDistance,	26,	0x001a,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSDestDistance,	Rational,	Indicates the distance to the destination point.
GPSProcessingMethod,	27,	0x001b,	GPSInfo,	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSProcessingMethod,	Undefined,	A character string recording the name of the method used for location finding. The first byte indicates the character code used, and this is followed by the name of the method.
