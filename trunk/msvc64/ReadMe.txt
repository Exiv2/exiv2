exiv2\msvc64\ReadMe.txt
-----------------------

Updated: 2011-01-02 
This is work in progress.
However this is sufficiently robust to be in current use by a commercial licensee of exiv2.

1)   Working
     Build 32bit and 64bit builds of exiv2.exe (and libraries exiv2lib,expat,zlib,xmpsdk).
     Builds with VS2005, 2008 and 2010.
     Supports zlib-1.2.5 or zlib-1.2.3
     Notes added about building with VS2010 Express
     setbuild.py "doctors" the project files for DevStudio Express

2)   TODO (in priority order)
     a) Provide a "runner.bat" build verification test script
     b) Build sample/test applications (exifprint etc)
     c) Use .vsprop files to hold "common" project settings
   
     Assistance appreciated if you wish to become involved.

1    Build Instructions

1.1  Tools
     This has been tested with the "Pro" versions of VS 2005/08/10
     Express editions dont support 64 bit builds, however it is
     possible to build 32 bit libraries with "Express".
     See notes below about DevStudio Express and building only Win32 or x64 builds

1.2  Install zlib and expat sources.
     I use the directory c:\gnu for this purpose, however the name isn't important.

     c:\gnu>dir
      Directory of c:\gnu
     2010-12-05  10:05    <DIR>             exiv2                <--- this tree
     2010-12-02  21:06    <DIR>             expat-2.0.1          <--- "vanilla" expat 2.0.1 source tree
     2010-12-02  20:58    <DIR>             zlib-1.2.5           <--- "vanilla" zlib 1.2.5 source tree
     2010-12-02  20:58    <DIR>             zlib-1.2.3 OPTIONAL  <--- "vanilla" zlib 1.2.3 source tree
     c:\gnu>
     
     The URLs from which to obtain zlib and expat are documented in exiv2\msvc\README-MSVC.txt
     expat-2.0.1 is available from http://voxel.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/expat/expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
     zlib-1.2.5  is available from http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz

1.3  Open exiv2\msvc64\exiv2.sln
     Projects are zlib, expat, xmpsdk, exiv2lib, exiv2
     Build/Batch build...  Select All, Build
     - 5 projects       (zlib, expat, xmpsdk, exiv2lib, exiv2)
     x 2 Platforms      (x64|Win32)
     x 4 Configurations (Debug|Release|DebugDLL|ReleaseDLL)
     = 5x2x4 = 40 builds.
     
     If you haven't installed the x64 compiler, don't select the 64 bit configurations!
     You may have to hand-end it vcproj and sln files to hide the 64bit information.
     See the notes about DevStudio Express for more information about this. 
     
     Build time is 15 minutes on a 2.2GHz Duo Core and consumes 1.0 gBytes of disk space.
     
1.4  What is built
     The DLL builds use the DLL version of the C runtime libraries
     The Debug|Release builds use static C runtime libraries
     This is discussed in exiv2\msvc\README-MSVC.txt 
     
1.5  Building with zlib1.2.3
     By default, msvc64 builds with zlib-1.2.5
     You can build with zlib1.2.3.  To do this:
     
     1) copy/y exiv2\msvc64\zlib123\zlib.vcproj exiv2\msvc64\zlib\zlib.vcproj

     2) You will need the sources in a directory parallel to exiv2
     c:\gnu>dir
      Directory of c:\gnu
     2010-12-05  10:05    <DIR>             exiv2                <--- this tree
     2010-12-02  21:06    <DIR>             expat-2.0.1          <--- "vanilla" expat 2.0.1 source tree
     2010-12-02  20:58    <DIR>             zlib-1.2.5           <--- "vanilla" zlib 1.2.5 source tree
     2010-12-02  20:58    <DIR>             zlib-1.2.3 OPTIONAL  <--- "vanilla" zlib 1.2.3 source tree
     c:\gnu>
     Please see exiv2\msvc\README-MSVC.txt for information about obtaining zlib-1.2.3

1.6  Express editions of DevStudio (or 32 bit only builds, or 64 bit only builds)
     Express does not provide a 64bit compiler.
     You can build 32 bit libraries with DevStudio Express (with a little effort)
     
     Before loading the project, use the python script setbuild.py to select Win32:
     
     	c:\gnu\exiv2\msvc64>setbuild Win32
     	
     setbuild.py is none destructive.  If you have a 64 bit compiler, you can:
     1)	Restore the build environment with:   setbuild all
     2) Select x64 bit builds only with:      setbuild.py x64
     
     If you don't have python available (it's a free download from ActiveState.com), 
     you can "doctor" to project files manually to remove mentiosn of X64 using an editor:
     
     Cleanup your tree and edit the files.
     cd exiv2\msvc64
     call cleaner.bat
     for /r %f in (*.vcproj) do notepad %f
     for /r %f in (*.sln)    do notepad %f
     
     I personally don't recomment notepad for any purpose at all.
     I use TextPad http://www.textpad.com/  Notepad++ is also good.
     
     DevStudio Express 2010 (and presumably 2005 and 2008) do not have the "Batch Build" feature.
     Select "exiv2" right-click "Set as Startup Project" and
     Select Platform="Win32" Configuration="Debug|DebugDLL|Release|ReleaseDLL"  Build.
     Build the Configurations you need.  Build time is about 2 minutes/Configuration.
     
2    Design

     expat and zlib do not provide 64bit builds for DevStudio,
     so it has been necessary to create the build environments for exiv2.
     However, we don't include the source code for zlib or expat - only the build environment.
     You are expected to install the "vanilla" expat and zlib libraries
     in a directory at the same level as exiv2.
     I personally always build in the directory c:\gnu,
     however the name/location/spaces of the build directory are all irrelevant,
     it's only the relative position of expat-2.0.1 and zlib-1.2.5 that matter.
     The names expat-2.0.1 and zlib-1.2.5 fixed (and used by the .vcproj files)

     zlib and expat
     exiv2\msvc64\zlib\zlib.{sln|vcproj}                    DevStudio files
     ..\..\..\zlib-1.2.5\                                   Source code

     exiv2\msvc64\expat\expat.sln expat.vcproj              DevStudio files
     ..\..\..\expat-2.0.1\                                  Source code

2.1  Architecture
     There are directories for every component:
     The libraries: zlib, expat, xmpsdk, exiv2lib
     Applications:  exiv2 (exifprint.exe and other sample apps will be added on request)
     
     For each component, there are three build directories:
     exiv2lib\build											intermediate results
     exiv2lib\Win32\{Debug|Release|DebugDLL|ReleaseDLL}     32 bit builds
     exiv2lib\x64\{Debug|Release|DebugDLL|ReleaseDLL}       64 bit builds
     
     Final builds and include directories (for export to "foreign" projects)
     bin\{win32|x84}\Win32\{Debug|Release|DebugDLL|ReleaseDLL} 
     include
     
2.2  Changing the version of expat/zlib/xmpsdk
     At the moment, zlib contains references to zlib-1.2.3 and expat to expat-2.0.1
     It is planned to support zlib 1.2.5 shortly and these notes will be updated at that time.

2.3  Relationship with msvc build environment
     msvc64 is similar to msvc.
     However there are significant differences:
     1) msvc64 supports 64bit and 32bit builds
     2) msvc64 provides projects to build expat and zlib
     3) msvc64 is designed to accomodate new versions of expat and zlib when they become available.
     4) msvc64 supports DevStudio 2005, 2008 and 2010 (no support for 2003)
     5) msvc64 does not require you to build 'vanilla' expat and zlib projects in advance
     6) msvc64 does not support the organize application
     7) msvc64 does not build the sample/test applications (such as exfprint.exe)
     8) msvc64 has no test/build verification scripts
     9) msvc64 supports building with zlib1.2.5 (default) or zlib1.2.3
     
     msvc will continue to be supported for 32 bit builds using DevStudio 2003/05/08,
     however there is no plan to enhance or develop msvc going forward.
