Exiv2 uses cmake, a cross-platform build system, to control the
compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
configuration files.

The old make and MSVC build files are currently still around but are
considered deprecated in the unstable branch. They will disappear once
the cmake build process is feature-complete, stable and documented. Or
maybe earlier to force me to get there.

To uninstall Exiv2, run:

    $ make uninstall     >>>>>   TODO

    in the meantime, on UNIX-like systems, use

    $ xargs rm < install_manifest.txt


b) Using the cmake GUI

   ccmake





Dependencies
============

cmake itself

migrate the rest here from README, test one by one

Further TODOs:

  * Rename configuration settings to EXIV2_*, e.g., EXIV2_ENABLE_SHARED
  * Two cmake projects: 1) exiv2 2) samples, common config in config/
  * Is it possible to not have CMakeLists.txt file in the top dir?
  * --disable-visibility
  * cross-compilation
  * Release build and packaging scripts
  * emacs M-c command to (re-)compile
