Building and Installing
=======================

Exiv2 comes with a GNU configure script and uses GNU Libtool. Run the
following commands from the top directory (containing this file) to
configure, build and install the library and utility:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

The default install locations are /usr/local/lib for the library,
/usr/local/bin for the exiv2 utility and /usr/local/include/exiv2 for
the header files. Use the --prefix=directory option of the configure 
script to change this default. Run ./configure --help to see a list
of all options.

To build Exiv2 with MSVC 7.1, use the solution file msvc/exiv2.sln.


Troubleshooting
===============

If you have problems building Exiv2, check the generated
config/config.mk and config/config.h files. You should *not* need to
modify any Makefile directly, in particular not src/Makefile!


Uninstalling
============

    $ make uninstall


Reporting bugs
==============

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, please send electronic mail 
to the Exiv2 mailing list via

    http://home.arcor.de/ahuggel/exiv2/support.html

or submit bug reports directly to the bug tracking system at

    http://dev.robotbattle.com/bugs/main_page.php


Developing with Exiv2
=====================

If you downloaded the software directly from the subversion
repository, and you want to build it using the GNU configure script,
then you need to have GNU autoconf installed on your system and create
the configure script as the first step:

    $ make config

To generate the documentation ($ make doc), you will further need
python, doxygen, graphviz and xsltproc.

Exiv2 uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a variety
of systems. While this is very nice for making usable binaries, it can
be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that reason, compilation
of shared libraries can be turned off by specifying the
--disable-shared option to the configure script.
