This is Exiv2, a C++ library and a command line utility to read and
write Exif and Iptc image metadata. The homepage of Exiv2 is:

documentation and metadata tags.


Building and Installing
=======================

To build Exiv2 from the distributed tarball on UNIX-like systems
(e.g., GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, MinGW), use the included GNU configure
script. Run the following commands from the top directory (containing
this file) to configure, build and install the library and utility:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

If you downloaded the source code directly from the subversion
repository, you won't have a configure script. Run make config to 
generate it and see the section "Hacking" below.

The default install locations are /usr/local/lib for the library,
/usr/local/bin for the exiv2 utility and /usr/local/include/exiv2 for
the header files. Use the --prefix=directory option of the configure
script to change this default. Run ./configure --help to see a list of
all options.

To build Exiv2 with MSVC 7.1, use the solution file msvc/exiv2.sln.

To uninstall Exiv2 from a UNIX-like system, run:

    $ make uninstall


Troubleshooting
===============

If you have problems building Exiv2 on UNIX-like systems, check the
generated config/config.mk and config/config.h files. You should *not*
need to modify any Makefile directly, in particular not src/Makefile!


Support
=======

Please send feedback or queries by email to the Exiv2 mailing list via

    http://www.exiv2.org/support.html

Bug reports can be submitted directly to the bug tracking system at

    http://dev.robotbattle.com/bugs/main_page.php


Hacking
=======

A pkg-config .pc file is installed together with the library.
Application developers can use pkg-config(1) to obtain correct compile
and link time flags for the Exiv2 library.

If you downloaded Exiv2 directly from the subversion repository, and
you want to build it using the GNU configure script, then you need to
have GNU Autoconf installed on your system and create the configure
script as the first step:

    $ make config

Then run the usual ./configure; make; make install commands.

To generate the documentation (make doc), you will further need
python, doxygen, graphviz and xsltproc.

Exiv2 uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a variety
of systems. While this is very nice for making usable binaries, it can
be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that reason, compilation
of shared libraries can be turned off by specifying the
--disable-shared option to the configure script.
