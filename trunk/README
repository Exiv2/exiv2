Exiv2
*****

Welcome to Exiv2, a C++ library and a command line utility to read and
write Exif and IPTC image metadata. The homepage of Exiv2 is:

    http://www.exiv2.org/

Point your browser to doc/index.html for the complete Exiv2 API
documentation and metadata tag reference.

See doc/ChangeLog for a description of recent changes to Exiv2.


Building and Installing
=======================

On UNIX-like systems (including GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, MinGW), use the 
GNU configure script. Run the following commands from the top directory 
(containing this file) to configure, build and install the library and 
utility:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

If you downloaded the source code from the subversion repository, you 
won't have a configure script. Run 'make config' to generate it and see 
the section "Hacking" below.

The default install locations are /usr/local/lib for the library,
/usr/local/bin for the exiv2 utility and /usr/local/include/exiv2 for the
header files. Use the --prefix=directory option of the configure script to
change the default. Run './configure --help' to see a list of all options.

To build Exiv2 with MSVC 7.1 or 8.0, use the solution file msvc/exiv2.sln.

To uninstall Exiv2 from a UNIX-like system, run:

    $ make uninstall


Dependencies
============

The following features are enabled by default and may *) require external
libraries. They can be controlled through configure options.

Feature                    Package   Configure options
-------------------------  -------   ----------------------------
PNG image support          zlib      --without-zlib
                                     --with-zlib=DIR
National language support  gettext   --disable-nls
Decoding Windows XP tags   libiconv  --without-libiconv-prefix
                                     --with-libiconv-prefix[=DIR]

zlib         http://www.zlib.net/
gettext  *)  http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
libiconv *)  http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

*) Some systems have gettext and iconv in libc. The configure script 
should detect this.


Troubleshooting
===============

If you have problems building Exiv2 on UNIX-like systems, check the
generated config/config.mk and config/config.h files. You should *not*
need to modify any Makefile directly, in particular not src/Makefile!


Support
=======

Please send feedback or queries by email to the Exiv2 mailing list via

    http://www.exiv2.org/support.html

Bug reports can be submitted directly to the bug tracking system at

    http://dev.robotbattle.com/bugs/main_page.php


Hacking
=======

A pkg-config .pc file is installed together with the library.
Application developers can use pkg-config(1) to obtain correct compile
and link time flags for the Exiv2 library.

If you downloaded Exiv2 directly from the subversion repository, and
you want to build it using the GNU configure script, then you need to
have GNU Autoconf installed on your system and create the configure
script as the first step:

    $ make config

Then run the usual './configure; make; make install' commands.

To generate the documentation (run 'make doc'), you will further need
doxygen, graphviz, python and xsltproc.

Exiv2 uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a variety
of systems. While this is very nice for making usable binaries, it can
be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that reason, compilation
of shared libraries can be turned off by specifying the
--disable-shared option to the configure script.
