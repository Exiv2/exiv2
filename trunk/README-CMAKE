NOTE: CMake scripts still under developpement. Use them only if you're prepared 
to fix them. Look TODO-CMAKE.txt for pending task. Thanks for your help.

Exiv2 uses cmake, a cross-platform build system, to control the
compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
configuration files.

The old make and MSVC build files are currently still around but are
considered deprecated in the unstable branch. They will disappear once
the cmake build process is feature-complete, stable and documented. Or
maybe earlier to force me to get there.
