-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 

* CMake scripts are functional and used to perform the daily build on the buildserver.

* The existing automake (./configure), and msvc2005 build files will continue
  to be supported by exiv2 for at least v0.27 (and probably longer)
  
  The msvc-2003 build files are deprecated and will not be supported after v0.26.

Exiv2 uses cmake, a cross-platform build system, to control the
compilation process using platform/compiler independent configuration files.

1 CMake resources
=================

You have to install cmake on your target system.

Home: http://www.cmake.org/
Help: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/help.html
Doc:  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html
Wiki: http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake
FAQ:  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ

2 Building and Installing on Linux
==================================

This process also covers MacOS-X Terminal, Cygwin and MinGW users.

a) From the command line 

Run the following commands from the top directory (containing this
file) to configure, build and install the library and utility:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ make install

To modify the configuration

    $ ccmake ..

Usual CMake options :

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : decide where the program will be install on your computer.
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     : decide which type of build you want. You can chose between:
                         "debugfull".     : for hacking. Include all debug information.
                         "debug".
                         "profile".
                         "relwithdebinfo" : default. use gcc -O2 -g options.
                         "release"        : generate stripped and optimized bin files. For packaging.

Specific Exiv2 options :

-DEXIV2_ENABLE_SHARED        : Build exiv2 as a shared library (dll).            [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_XMP           : Build with XMP metadata support.                  [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_LIBXMP        : Build a static convenience Library for XMP.       [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_PNG           : Build with png support (requires libz).           [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_NLS           : Build native language support (requires gettext). [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_PRINTUCS2     : Build with Printucs2.                             [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_LENSDATA      : Build including lens data.                        [default=on ]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_COMMERCIAL    : Build with the EXV_COMMERCIAL_VERSION symbol set. [default=off]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_BUILD_SAMPLES : Build the unit tests.                             [default=off]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_BUILD_PO      : Build translations files.                         [default=off]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_CURL          : USE Libcurl for HttpIo                            [default=off]
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_SSH           : USE Libssh for SshIo                              [default=off]

Default install locations

Use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX like this :

"cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr"  is equivalent to "./configure --prefix=/usr" with automake/configure.

To uninstall Exiv2, run:

    $ make uninstall

b) Using the cmake GUI

   ccmake

3 Building and installing for Visual Studio Users
=================================================

exiv2 provides three build environment for users of Visual Studio:

cmake:    This environment
msvc2005: 32 bit AND 64 bit build environment for MSVC 2005 and later (2008/10/12/13)
msvc2003: 32 bit build environment for MSVC 2003 (deprecated after v0.26)

CMake doesn't build code.  It generates build environments.
CMake is a language for describing builds and the CMake interpreter generates
the build environment for your system.

CMake generates MSVC .sln and .vcproj files for your target environment.
The files generated by CMake provide 4 configs: Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel
The current architecture of CMake requires you to decide before running cmake:
1)	The version of DevStudio
2)  32bit or 64 bit builds
3)  Building static or shared libraries

We have two contributed CMake Build Environments:

1 contrib/cmake/msvc
  Please read contrib/cmake/msvc/ReadMe.txt
  
2 contrib/build/msvc

  The scripts require:
  - Cygwin (in order to download all dependencies (zlib, expat, ssl, curl, ssh), including exiv2 trunk from svn)
  - CMake
  - SVN (optional)

  Then
   - put the two scripts (build.cmd and setenv.cmd) into a completely empty directory
   - adapt the paths in setenv.cmd
   - open the VS command line shell
   - execute build.cmd (if there are any errors, the script should tell you)
 
  Exiv2 should be packaged in the dist directory with all the .lib, include and binary files you need.
