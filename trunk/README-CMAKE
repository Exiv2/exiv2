NOTE: 

* CMake scripts still under developpement. Use them only if you're prepared 
to fix them. Look TODO-CMAKE.txt for pending task. Thanks for your help.

* The old make and MSVC build files are currently still around but will be 
considered deprecated for 0.20.0 release. They will disappear once
the cmake build process is feature-complete, stable and documented. Or
maybe earlier to force me to get there.

Exiv2 uses cmake, a cross-platform build system, to control the
compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
configuration files.

Cmake resources
===============

Home: http://www.cmake.org/

Building and Installing
=======================

a) From the command line 

Run the following commands from the top directory (containing this
file) to configure, build and install the library and utility:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ make install

To modify the configuration

    $ ccmake ..

Usual CMake options :

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : decide where the program will be install on your computer.
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     : decide which type of build you want. You can chose between:
                         "debugfull".     : for hacking. Include all debug information.
                         "debug".
                         "profile".
                         "relwithdebinfo" : default. use gcc -O2 -g options.
                         "release"        : generate stripped and optimized bin files. For packaging.

Specific Exiv2 options :

-DEXIV2_ENABLE_SHARED       : Build exiv2 as a shared library (dll).
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_XMP          : Build with XMP metadata support.
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_LIBXMP       : Build a static convenience Library for XMP.
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_PNG          : Build with png support (requires libz).
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_NLS          : Build native language support (requires gettext).
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_PRINTUCS2    : Build with Printucs2.
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_LENSDATA     : Build including lens data.
-DEXIV2_ENABLE_COMMERCIAL   : Build with the EXV_COMMERCIAL_VERSION symbol set.
-EXIV2_ENABLE_BUILD_SAMPLES : Build the unit tests.

Default install locations

Use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX like this :

"cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr"  is equivalent to "./configure --prefix=/usr" with automake/configure.

To uninstall Exiv2, run:

    $ make uninstall

b) Using the cmake GUI

   ccmake
