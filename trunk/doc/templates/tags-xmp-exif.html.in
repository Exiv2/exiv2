<h2>Exif Schema for Exif-specific Properties</h2>
<p>The following table lists the XMP properties defined solely by Exif.</p>
<p>Note: A number of Exif 2.3 properties are not included in XMP. These are generally
 properties that relate directly to the image stream, or that are of little use without access
 to the image stream. A general XMP principle is that XMP metadata should have value
 in and of itself, separate from the primary file content. The omitted properties include:
 StripOffsets, RowsPerStrip, StripByteCounts, JPEGInterchangeFormat, and
 JPEGInterchangeFormatLength.</p>
<p>Note: Properties beginning with "GPS" are GPS properties that are also used by DIG-35 and
 are part of the JPEG-2000 standard.
