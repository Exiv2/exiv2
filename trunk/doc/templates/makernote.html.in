<h1>MakerNote Formats and Specifications</h1>

<p>
The Makernote is tag 0x927c in the Exif IFD. According to the 
<a title="The Exif 2.2 standard (PDF)" href="http://tsc.jeita.or.jp/avs/data/cp3451.pdf">
Exif 2.2 standard</a>, the makernote is <i>"a tag for manufacturers of
Exif writers to record any desired information. The contents are up to
the manufacturer, but this tag should not be used for any other than
its intended purpose."</i></p> 

<p>Unfortunately, most vendors do not publish their makernote specifications. (Why not?) 
Most of the <a href="#R0">specifications available on the Internet</a> 
were reverse-engineered. Judging from the size of many makernote fields, manufacturers 
apparently store a lot of information there and from the available specifications, 
some of this is certainly quite interesting. For example, makernotes may contain 
information about the lens used, contrast, saturation and sharpness settings, image 
quality settings, etc.</p>

<p>Many (but not all) vendors write the makernote in TIFF IFD (Image File Directory) format, 
i.e., in the same format as the rest of the Exif information is encoded. Although this may 
appear to make sense at first glance, it actually complicates the situation for programs that 
attempt to write to the Exif data. The problem is that IFDs contain offsets relative to the 
start of the Exif data. That implies that if an Exif writer moves a makernote field encoded in 
IFD format to a different location within the Exif data, it gets corrupted. The reason to
write to the Exif data could be as simple as to add copyright information, an Exif comment, 
etc. In my opinion, this is a bug in the specification. In fact, some vendors seem to have
recognized this problem and use offsets relative to somewhere at the beginning of the makernote 
field for the makernote IFD.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the structures of the makernote field used by some vendors. 
Please let me know if you find further specifications on the Internet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.exif.org/">Exif.org</a> has another table with similar 
  info and sample pictures: <a href="http://www.exif.org/samples.html">Digital 
  Camera Sample Images</a>. According to this source, (at least some) Ricoh and 
  Kodak cameras do not write the makernote in IFD format.</p>
