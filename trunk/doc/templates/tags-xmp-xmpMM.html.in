<h2>XMP Media Management Schema</h2>
<p>The XMP Media Management Schema is primarily for use by digital asset management (DAM) systems.</p>
<p>The following XMP properties are "owned" by the DAM system and should be set by applications
under their direction; they should not be used by unmanaged files: xmpMM:ManagedFrom,
xmpMM:Manager, xmpMM:ManageTo, xmpMM:ManageUI, xmpMM:ManagerVariant.</p>
<p>The following properties are owned by the DAM system for managed files, but can also be
used by applications for unmanaged files: xmpMM:DerivedFrom, xmpMM:DocumentID,
xmpMM:RenditionClass, xmpMM:RenditionParams, xmpMM:VersionID, xmpMM:Versions.</p>
<p>The xmpMM:History property is always owned by the application.
