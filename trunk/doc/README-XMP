Exiv2 XMP support
*****************

On UNIX-like systems, XMP support is controlled with the --enable-xmp
and --disable-xmp options to the configure script.
Building Exiv2 with XMP support requires the Expat XML parser library
(http://expat.sourceforge.net/). The --with-expat configure option
can be used if it is installed in a non-standard directory.
The MSVC project files for Windows are setup to always build Exiv2
with XMP support.

See the main README file for general build information.

For API documentation of XMP classes and samples, consult the online
documentation at http://www.exiv2.org/doc or build the documentation
and go to doc/html/getting-started.html

For details on the XMP support of the exiv2 command line tool, see
the exiv2(1) manual page and the sample command file doc/cmdxmp.txt


XMP Toolkit
===========

Exiv2 uses the XMPCore component of the Adobe XMP Toolkit (XMP SDK) to
parse and serialize XMP packets. Currently, it is integrated and
distributed with Exiv2. The xmpsdk/ directory of the Exiv2 distribution
contains the XMP SDK source code. The final solution should eventually
use an external XMP Toolkit.

Building the XMP Toolkit is transparent. Following the installation
steps described in the main README will ensure that the XMP Toolkit is
compiled if necessary. It is only needed if XMP support is enabled.
Building the XMP Toolkit results in a "convenience library" in
xmpsdk/src/. This library is only used to link the Exiv2 library with;
it is not installed.

If you experience problems building this library, please email to the
Exiv2 forum for help, http://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/boards
and not to Adobe directly.


Source
======

XMP-Toolkit-SDK-4.4.2.zip obtained via
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/sdk/eula.html

The following files were copied from the original XMP SDK
distribution, essentially:

public/include/*        -> xmpsdk/include
source/common/*         -> xmpsdk/src
source/XMPCore/*        -> xmpsdk/src
build/XMP_BuildInfo.h   -> xmpsdk/src

The MD5 functions included with XMP SDK were replaced with an
equivalent implementation which is in the public domain. For more
details refer to Exiv2 issue #600 and the SVN repository:
