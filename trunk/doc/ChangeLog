Changes from version 0.9 to 0.9.1
---------------------------------

* Exiv2 library
	- 0000451: [exif] Fixed bug where an invalid Exif tag was created for 
	           the user comment, when the tag was newly added to an image.
		   (Thanks to Anatoliy Kovalenko for reporting this bug)
		 - Added enum MetadataId and Image::supportsMetadata() to check what 
	           metadata an image class supports. Changed CrwImage to silently 
	           ignore calls to Iptc related functions instead of throwing an Error.
		   (Thanks to Will Stokes for suggesting the check feature)
		 - Cleaned up some #include statements (mentioned here because this 
		   may lead to unexpected compiler errors).


Changes from version 0.8 to 0.9
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility
	- 0000450: [exif] Added action "fixiso" to copy the ISO setting from Nikon 
	           Makernotes to the regular Exif tag Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings.
	- 0000448: [tools] Added options -p and -t, -T to preserve file timestamps and
	           set the timestamp according to the Exif timestamp.
	           (Thanks to Stephan Ahlswede for suggesting the -p feature)
	- 0000446: [misc] Added option -c to set the JPEG comment to the utility.
	           (Thanks to Tristan Savatier for the suggestion)

	           tracking to the configure script, which is useful to create 
		   "Universal Binaries" under Mac OSX. 
		   (Thanks to Will Stokes for the suggestion)
	         - [exivsimple] Changed DllTypeId::time and DllTypeId::date to
	           DllTypeId::isoTime and DllTypeId::isoDate to avoid a name clash.


Changes from version 0.7 to 0.8
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility
                 - [tools] Added -S .suf option to the utility. This allows, e.g, 
	           to use Canon THM files as source file for the insert command.
		 - [doc] Added man page. (Based on Peter KELEMEN's Debian man page.)

* Exiv2 library

		   list.
		 - Added a tag and dataset title (label).
		 - Added #ifndef SUPPRESS_WARNINGS blocks around all output from the 
		   library: compile with -DSUPPRESS_WARNINGS for a quiet library.
		 - Implemented "copy-on-write" strategy for MemIo to ensure that the 
		   original buffer is only copied if necessary and never modified.
		 - Added exiv2-config script. Applications that include exiv2 headers 
		   and link with the installed library can use this in their build 
		   commands.


Changes from version 0.6.2 to 0.7
---------------------------------

	- 0000427: [misc] Standardized factories according to the implementation. 
	           of ImageFactory (MakerNoteFactory). Linking with mn.o is not
		   necessary anymore.
	- 0000420: [build environment] Defines should have a library specific 
	           prefix, like e.g., EXV_HAVE_CONFIG_H.
	- 0000417: [exif] ExifData needs proper copy constructor and assignment. 
	- 0000426: [iptc] Fixed problem which prevented Exiv2 from reading IPTC

	  sequence with error output right
	
* Exiv2 library

	* Added support to build Makernotes from scratch

	* Added support to build IFD1 (Thumbnail) entries from scratch
	
	* Open image files on demand rather than keeping them open. Bug #393 (Brad)

Changes from version 0.4 to 0.5
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added -pI print mode to print Iptc data.

	* Bugfix: Use timegm() and gmtime() instead of mktime() and
	  localtime() to avoid problems when adjusting timestamps.
	  Thanks to Samir Rostum for pointing out this bug.

	* Added timegm() from the tz distribution for platforms which
	  do not have this function.

* Exiv2 library

	* Added full Iptc read and write support. Thanks to Brad Schick for
          this and a lot more contributions to this release.

	* Converted Metadatum to an abstract base class, added Exifdatum
	  and Iptcdatum classes. Migration of existing programs: Use class
	  Exifdatum instead of Metadatum. (Brad Schick)
	
	* Added Key, ExifKey and IptcKey class hierarchy. Requires changes
	  to existing pograms: Use class ExifKey where plain std::string
	  keys were used before (e.g., ExifData::findKey()).

	* Changed Exif keys to 'Exif.ifdItem.tagName' to be consistent
	  with the new Iptc keys. All keys of existing programs need to be
	  updated. See the web pages or documentation for the new keys.

Changes from version 0.3 to 0.4
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Less rigid command line argument parsing: Guess the action from the 
          option given and use print as the default action.

	* Print Nikon makernote values for ISO Speed, Quality and WhiteBalance
          in the summary.

* Exiv2 library

	* Fixed ExifData::copyFromMetadata to automatically add missing
          offset tags. Thanks to Joseph Heled for identifying this bug.

	* Started to fix MSVC errors and warnings. Thanks to Steven R. King for
	  his work to get Exiv2 to compile on MSVC. The task is not yet 
	  completed but the library should compile without too many warnings.

	* Added three different Nikon makernote formats.

	* IfdMakerNote: Replaced too simple prefix with a more general concept 
          of a makernote header. 

	* Added the makernote buffer to the arguments passed to the makernote 
	  create function. This allows the makernote create function to 
          determine the exact makernote needed based on its content. The new 
          concept is used to automatically determine which of the three Nikon 
          makernotes to create.

	* Fixed MakerNoteFactory::match() to prefer an exact match over a 
          wildcard match with the same number of matching characters (Key 
          "Nikon" now prefers registry entry "Nikon" over "Nikon*"), simplified
          the return value of match() to an integer score value.

	* Sigma makernote: Added "FOVEON" and "*" to registry. 

	* Added len argument and boundary checks to various read functions,
	  in particular, the IFD read method. 

	* Improved handling of corrupt IFDs: Truncate field if offset points 
	  outside of the available buffer.

	* Slightly improved error handling: strError() is now a static member 
	  of ExifData.

	* Added exifcomment example program.

	* Fixed an embarassing bug in ExifData::updateEntries, which caused 
	  write after erasing metadata to write back the original metadata.

	* Fixed TypeInfoTable to return invalid if typeId is too large.

	* Makefile: (un)install targets now only (un)install exiv2.

	* Code cleanup, documentation updates and miscellaneous bug fixes.
