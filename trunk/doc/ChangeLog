Changes from version 0.6 to 0.6.1
---------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added option to modify Iptc and Exif metadata based on a command file
	
* Exiv2 library

	* Fixed bug #407: Writing metadata to image after modifications may
	  lose thumbnail. Thanks to Jeffrey J. Early for pointing out this bug.
	
	* Added CommentValue


Changes from version 0.5 to 0.6
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added options to extract, insert and delete different types of metadata 

	* Added option to print the Jpeg comment 

	* Changed semantics of print option `i' to Iptc
	  (`t' for translated Exif data)

	* Replaced std::cout << "\n" with std::endl to flush and get the 
	  sequence with error output right
	
* Exiv2 library

	* Added support to build Makernotes from scratch

	* Added support to build IFD1 (Thumbnail) entries from scratch
	
	* Open image files on demand rather than keeping them open. Bug #393 (Brad)
	
	* Added data area concept to Value, ValueType, Entry, Ifd. Feature #395
	
	* Revamped Thumbnail classes to use the new data area feature. Feature #398

	* Added ExifData::setJpegThumbnail 
	
	* Improved implementation of Exif and Iptc keys, added support for
          keys with unknown tag names
		
	* Added ExifData::op[] and Exifdatum op= and similar operators to 
	  IptcData and Iptcdatum. This operator stuff allows for things like: 
	  exifData["Exif.Thumbnail.Compression"] = uint16_t(6);
	
	* Converted class hierarchies to use std::auto_ptr where appropriate

	* Replaced custom integer types with C99 types

	* Added test data and drivers to the repository
	
	* Right align output stream for date and time writes. Bug #397 (Brad)
		
	* Updated documentation

* MSVC related (Thanks to Brad Schick)
	
	* Added exivsimple: a Windows dll that allows languages such as 
	  C# and VB to access limited metadata capabilities (Brad)

	* Added and write2-test projects to MSVC build (Brad)
	
	* Added mn.cpp to all MSVC projects. Fixes bug #396 (Brad)
	
	* Fixed various MSVC 7.1 build errors. Bug #394 (Brad)
	
	* Added write-test to MSVC build project (Brad)


Changes from version 0.4 to 0.5
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added -pI print mode to print Iptc data.

	* Bugfix: Use timegm() and gmtime() instead of mktime() and
	  localtime() to avoid problems when adjusting timestamps.
	  Thanks to Samir Rostum for pointing out this bug.

	* Added timegm() from the tz distribution for platforms which
	  do not have this function.

* Exiv2 library

	* Added full Iptc read and write support. Thanks to Brad Schick for
          this and a lot more contributions to this release.

	* Converted Metadatum to an abstract base class, added Exifdatum
	  and Iptcdatum classes. Migration of existing programs: Use class
	  Exifdatum instead of Metadatum. (Brad Schick)
	
	* Added Key, ExifKey and IptcKey class hierarchy. Requires changes
	  to existing pograms: Use class ExifKey where plain std::string
	  keys were used before (e.g., ExifData::findKey()).

	* Changed Exif keys to 'Exif.ifdItem.tagName' to be consistent
	  with the new Iptc keys. All keys of existing programs need to be
	  updated. See the web pages or documentation for the new keys.
	
	* Revamped class Image and introduced byte* interface. (Brad Schick)
	
	* Added autoconf configure script.

	* Added MSVC project files. (Brad Schick)
	
	* Appended 'Id' to Ifd ids to work around a g++-3.4 problem.

	* Updated documentation.

	
Changes from version 0.3 to 0.4
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Less rigid command line argument parsing: Guess the action from the 
          option given and use print as the default action.

	* Print Nikon makernote values for ISO Speed, Quality and WhiteBalance
          in the summary.

* Exiv2 library

	* Fixed ExifData::copyFromMetadata to automatically add missing
          offset tags. Thanks to Joseph Heled for identifying this bug.

	* Started to fix MSVC errors and warnings. Thanks to Steven R. King for
	  his work to get Exiv2 to compile on MSVC. The task is not yet 
	  completed but the library should compile without too many warnings.

	* Added three different Nikon makernote formats.

	* IfdMakerNote: Replaced too simple prefix with a more general concept 
          of a makernote header. 

	* Added the makernote buffer to the arguments passed to the makernote 
	  create function. This allows the makernote create function to 
          determine the exact makernote needed based on its content. The new 
          concept is used to automatically determine which of the three Nikon 
          makernotes to create.

	* Fixed MakerNoteFactory::match() to prefer an exact match over a 
          wildcard match with the same number of matching characters (Key 
          "Nikon" now prefers registry entry "Nikon" over "Nikon*"), simplified
          the return value of match() to an integer score value.

	* Sigma makernote: Added "FOVEON" and "*" to registry. 

	* Added len argument and boundary checks to various read functions,
	  in particular, the IFD read method. 

	* Improved handling of corrupt IFDs: Truncate field if offset points 
	  outside of the available buffer.

	* Slightly improved error handling: strError() is now a static member 
	  of ExifData.

	* Added exifcomment example program.

	* Fixed an embarassing bug in ExifData::updateEntries, which caused 
	  write after erasing metadata to write back the original metadata.

	* Fixed TypeInfoTable to return invalid if typeId is too large.

	* Makefile: (un)install targets now only (un)install exiv2.

	* Code cleanup, documentation updates and miscellaneous bug fixes.
