contrib/cmake/msvc/ReadMe.txt
-----------------------------

These scripts are "in development".  They are derived from Daniels contrib/build scripts.

Rather that endlessly discuss these scripts with Daniel
I'm going to do parallel development and see how that goes.

I'll discuss this with Daniel when I'm convinced my versions are working well.

The current status is "Work in Progress" = Not working yet.
These script are not for public use at the moment by Daniel or anybody else.
