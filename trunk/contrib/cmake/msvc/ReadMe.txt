-----------------------------

These scripts are "in development".
They are derived from Daniels contrib/build scripts.

Status:
2015-11-17 Added command-line parser
           Building exiv2 with zlib and expat and exiv2
           -webready = curl etc broken
2015-11-16 The current status is "Work in Progress" = Not working yet.
           These script are not for public use at the moment by Daniel or anybody else.

Rather than endlessly discuss these scripts with Daniel
I'm going to do parallel development and see how that goes.

I'll discuss this with Daniel when I'm convinced my versions are working well.
