NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2 is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC, XMP metadata and image
       comments and can read many vendor makernote tags. The  program  option-
       ally  converts  between	Exif tags, XMP properties and IPTC datasets as
       recommended by the Exif Standard, the IPTC Standard, the XMP specifica-
       tion and Metadata Working Group guidelines.
       The following image formats are supported:

       Type   Exif	   IPTC 	XMP	     Image Comments	     ICC Profile

       JP2    Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   -			     Read/Write

       o Support  for  GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
	 recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height	and  width  of
	 the image are determined.

       o Reading  other  TIFF-like  RAW image formats, which are not listed in
	 the table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The action argument is only required  if  it  is  not  clear  from  the
       options which action is implied.

       pr | print
	      Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the com-
	      mand exiv2 image.jpg will print a  summary  of  the  image  Exif
	      metadata.

       ex | extract
	      Extract  metadata  to  *.exv,  XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail
	      image files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
	      Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv,  XMP  sidecar  (*.xmp)
	      and thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix of
	      the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used
	      as  input  files,  this command can be used to copy the metadata
	      between files of different formats. Modification commands can be
	      applied on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
	      Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
	      Adjust  Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one
	      of the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
	      Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif,  IPTC  and
	      XMP metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
	      Rename  files  and/or  set file timestamps according to the Exif
	      create timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOrig-
	      inal  or,  if  not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the
	      timestamp. The filename format can be set with -r fmt, timestamp
	      options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
	      Copy  the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
	      makernote   ISO	tags   to   the   regular   Exif   ISO	  tag,
	      Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing stan-
	      dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
	      Fix the  character  encoding  of	Exif  Unicode  user  comments.
	      Decodes the comment using the auto-detected or specified charac-
	      ter encoding and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to spec-
	      ify the current encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.
	      When -V is combined with -v (Verbose version), build information
	      is printed to standard  output  along  with  a  list  of	shared
	      libraries which have been loaded into memory. Verbose version is
	      supported on Windows (MSVC, Cygwin and MinGW builds), MacOSX and
	      Linux and is provided for test and debugging.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence  warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library dur-
	      ing the program run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can  be
	      used at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
	      or 'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. -Qm is equivalent  to
	      -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show  unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't have
	      a name).

       -g key Only keys which match the given key (grep).
	      Multiple -g options can be used to grep info for	several  keys.
	      When  the  library  is  build with C++11, keys are matched using
	      std::regex::extended.  When build without C++11, keys  are  pro-
	      cessed  with  the  system  regular expression engine:  see man 3
	      regex.  Platforms which do not support regex use key for a  sub-
	      string match.  You can determine the availability of regex using
	      the command: exiv2 -v -V -g have_regex -g cplusplus.

	      exiv2 -g Date -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Image.DateTime	    Ascii      20  2012:08:07 16:01:05
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

	      -g (--grep) is only  applied  to	keys.	It  is	not  generally
	      applied to all output such as the default -ps report.

	      The  key	may  finish with the optional modifier /i to indicated
	      case insensitive.

       -K key Only report data for given key.
	      Multiple -K options can be used to report  more  than  a	single
	      key.

	      exiv2 -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

       -n enc Charset  to  use	to decode Exif Unicode user comments. enc is a
	      name understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.

       -k     Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
	      with  all  options  which  update  files. The flag is ignored by
	      read-only options.

       -t     Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
	      addition	to  renaming  the  file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action.

       -T     Only set the file timestamp according to the Exif  create  time-
	      stamp,  do  not  rename  the file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action. Note:  On  Windows  you  may
	      have  to set the TZ environment variable for this option to work
	      correctly.

       -f     Do not prompt before overwriting	existing  files  (force  over-
	      write).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1'
	      ('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.

       -a time
	      Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]].  This  option  is
	      only  used  with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds one hour,
	      1:01 adds one hour and one minute, -0:00:30  subtracts  30  sec-
	      onds.

       -Y yrs Time  adjustment	by a positive or negative number of years, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -O mon Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of months,  for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -D day Time  adjustment	by  a positive or negative number of days, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -p mode
	      Print mode for the 'print' action. Possible modes are:
	      s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
	      a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
	      e : print Exif metadata (shortcut for -PEkycv)
	      t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
	      v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
	      h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
	      i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
	      x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
	      c : JPEG comment
	      p : list available image previews, sorted by preview image  size
	      in pixels
	      C  :  print  image  ICC  Profile (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2
	      only)
	      R : print image structure recursively  (jpg,  png,  tiff,  webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      S  :  print  image  structure information (jpg, png, tiff, webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      X : print "raw" XMP (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2 only)

       -P flgs
	      Print flags for fine control of the tag list  ('print'  action).
	      Allows  control  of the type of metadata as well as data columns
	      included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
	      E : include Exif tags in the list
	      I : IPTC datasets
	      X : XMP properties
	      x : print a column with the tag number
	      g : group name
	      k : key
	      l : tag label
	      n : tag name
	      y : type
	      c : number of components (count)
	      s : size in bytes
	      v : plain data value (vanilla values)
	      V : plain data value AND the word 'set '	(for  use  with  exiv2
	      -m-)
	      t : interpreted (translated) human readable data
	      h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the 'delete' action. Possible targets are:
	      a : all supported metadata (the default)
	      e : Exif section
	      t : Exif thumbnail only
	      i : IPTC data
	      x : XMP packet
	      c : JPEG comment
	      C : ICC Profile
	      I : All IPTC data

       -i tgt Insert  target(s)  for the 'insert' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus an optional modifier:

	      X : Insert metadata from an XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  insert targets determine what metadata to insert from
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default  is  all of these. Note that the inserted XMP properties
	      include those converted to Exif and IPTC.

	      XX: Insert "raw" XMP metadata from a sidecar (see option -pX)

	      - : Read from stdin.  This option is intended for "filter" oper-
	      ations such as:
	      $  exiv2 -e{tgt}- filename | xmllint .... | exiv2 -i{tgt}- file-
	      name

	      Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF thumbnails),  and
	      must be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus a  target  to  extract
	      preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
	      p[&ltn&gt[,&ltm&gt  ...]]  :  Extract preview images. The optional comma
	      separated list of preview image numbers  is  used  to  determine
	      which  preview  images  to extract. The available preview images
	      and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.

	      C : Extract embedded ICC profile to &ltfile&gt.icc

	      X : Extract metadata to an  XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  extract targets determine what metadata to extract to
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default is all of these.

	      XX: Extract "raw" XMP metadata to a sidecar (see -pX)
		  You  may  not  use  modify commands with the -eXX option and
	      only XMP is written to the sidecar.

	      - : Output to stdout (see -i tgt for an example of this feature)


       -r fmt Filename	format for the 'rename' action. The format string fol-
	      lows strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:

	      :basename:     original filename without extension
	      :dirname:      name of the directory holding the original file
	      :parentname:   name of parent directory
	      Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG comment string to set in the image ('modify' action).  This
	      option  can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions
	      to modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
	      Command file for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  -m- represents standard-input.

       -M cmd Command line for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  The format for the commands is the same as that  of
	      the lines of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
	      Use suffix .suf for source files in 'insert' action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

	  exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

	  exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined, and a non-
       standard XMP namespace registered.

	  exiv2 -M"reg myprefix http://ns.myprefix.me/" -M"add Xmp.myprefix.Whom Mr. Smith" -M"set Exif.Image.Artist Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and	values
       different  from	those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to read all
       metadata  that  it can write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key or add  the
	      tag.

       add    Add a tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre-
	      vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined  |  SShort  |
	      SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
	      String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
	      XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

	      A  default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default
	      is determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It  can  optionally
	      be   enclosed  in  single  quotes  ('value')  or	double	quotes
	      ("value").

	      The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent  to
	      an  empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array
	      property, e.g., a bag.

	      The format of Exif Comment values includes an  optional  charset
	      specification at the beginning:
	      [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

	      Undefined  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
	      charset definition.

	      The format for an IPTC Date value is:

		  YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day)

	      The format for an IPTC Time value is:

		  HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds)

	      and may optionally be followed by:

		 -HH:MM or +HH:MM (hours, minutes ahead/behind UTC)

	      The format of Rational (and SRational) is one of:

		 integer | integer/integer | Fnumber | number

	      Rational Examples:

	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue 557429/62500" X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue F5.6" X.jpg

	      The Rational format Fnumber is for the  convenience  of  setting
	      aperture	values.  Aperture values are stored in Exif is an APEX
	      value which can be evaluated by the expression:

	      apex-value  =    log(Fnumber) * 2.0 / log(2.0)
	      number	  = exp(apex-value * log(2.0) / 2.0)

	      The Rational format Fnumber is valid for any Rational, even when
	      the  key	is not an Aperture.  More information about APEX value
	      is available from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX_system

	      The format of XMP LangAlt values includes an  optional  language
	      qualifier:
	      lang="language-code" text

	      lang="x-default"	is used if the value doesn't start with a lan-
	      guage qualifier.

	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="de-DE" Euros' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-GB" Pounds' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US" In God We Trust' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title All others pay cash' X.jpg

	      To remove a language specification, set the value to  ''	(empty
	      string)
	      exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US"' X.jpg
	      To remove all language specifications, delete the key:
	      $ exiv2 -M'del Xmp.dc.title' X.jpg
	      To register additional XMP namespaces, combine the command with:
	      reg prefix namespace

   Command file format
       Empty lines and lines starting with # in a  command  file  are  ignored
       (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

EXAMPLES
       exiv2 *.jpg
	      Prints  a  summary of the Exif information for all JPEG files in
	      the directory.

       exiv2 -pi image.jpg
	      Prints the IPTC metadata of the image.

       exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames  img_1234.jpg  (taken  on  13-Nov-05  at	22:58:31)   to
	      20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Extracts	 the   Exif   thumbnails   from  the  two  files  into
	      img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Inserts (copies) metadata from img1.exv  to  img1.jpg  and  from
	      img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
	      Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
	      view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
	      Extracts IPTC datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
	      the process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
	      Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp
	      into image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted  from
	      the "IPTC Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the
	      older IPTC IIM4 format.  The  inserted  XMP  properties  include
	      those in the "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2  -M"set  Exif.Photo.UserComment  charset=Ascii  New Exif comment"
       image.jpg

       Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
	      Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north.
	      The Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude  tag  consists
	      of  three  Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds
	      of the latitude and GPSLatitudeRef contains either  'N'  or  'S'
	      for north or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
	      Copy  all  metadata  from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG
	      files with corresponding basenames in the /data directory.  Note
	      that  this  copies  metadata as is, without any modifications to
	      adapt it to the requirements of the  target  format.  Some  tags
	      copied like this may not make sense in the target image.

NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2 is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC, XMP metadata and image
       comments and can read many vendor makernote tags. The  program  option-
       ally  converts  between	Exif tags, XMP properties and IPTC datasets as
       recommended by the Exif Standard, the IPTC Standard, the XMP specifica-
       tion and Metadata Working Group guidelines.
       The following image formats are supported:

       Type   Exif	   IPTC 	XMP	     Image Comments	     ICC Profile
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       JP2    Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   -			     Read/Write

       o Support  for  GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
	 recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height	and  width  of
	 the image are determined.

       o Reading  other  TIFF-like  RAW image formats, which are not listed in
	 the table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The action argument is only required  if  it  is  not  clear  from  the
       options which action is implied.

       pr | print
	      Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the com-
	      mand exiv2 image.jpg will print a  summary  of  the  image  Exif
	      metadata.

       ex | extract
	      Extract  metadata  to  *.exv,  XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail
	      image files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
	      Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv,  XMP  sidecar  (*.xmp)
	      and thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix of
	      the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used
	      as  input  files,  this command can be used to copy the metadata
	      between files of different formats. Modification commands can be
	      applied on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
	      Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
	      Adjust  Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one
	      of the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
	      Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif,  IPTC  and
	      XMP metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
	      Rename  files  and/or  set file timestamps according to the Exif
	      create timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOrig-
	      inal  or,  if  not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the
	      timestamp. The filename format can be set with -r fmt, timestamp
	      options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
	      Copy  the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
	      makernote   ISO	tags   to   the   regular   Exif   ISO	  tag,
	      Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing stan-
	      dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
	      Fix the  character  encoding  of	Exif  Unicode  user  comments.
	      Decodes the comment using the auto-detected or specified charac-
	      ter encoding and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to spec-
	      ify the current encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.
	      When -V is combined with -v (Verbose version), build information
	      is printed to standard  output  along  with  a  list  of	shared
	      libraries which have been loaded into memory. Verbose version is
	      supported on Windows (MSVC, Cygwin and MinGW builds), MacOSX and
	      Linux and is provided for test and debugging.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence  warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library dur-
	      ing the program run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can  be
	      used at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
	      or 'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. -Qm is equivalent  to
	      -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show  unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't have
	      a name).

       -g key Only keys which match the given key (grep).
	      Multiple -g options can be used to grep info for	several  keys.
	      When  the  library  is  build with C++11, keys are matched using
	      std::regex::extended.  When build without C++11, keys  are  pro-
	      cessed  with  the  system  regular expression engine:  see man 3
	      regex.  Platforms which do not support regex use key for a  sub-
	      string match.  You can determine the availability of regex using
	      the command: exiv2 -v -V -g have_regex -g cplusplus.

	      exiv2 -g Date -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Image.DateTime	    Ascii      20  2012:08:07 16:01:05
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

	      -g (--grep) is only  applied  to	keys.	It  is	not  generally
	      applied to all output such as the default -ps report.

	      The  key	may  finish with the optional modifier /i to indicated
	      case insensitive.

       -K key Only report data for given key.
	      Multiple -K options can be used to report  more  than  a	single
	      key.

	      exiv2 -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

       -n enc Charset  to  use	to decode Exif Unicode user comments. enc is a
	      name understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.

       -k     Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
	      with  all  options  which  update  files. The flag is ignored by
	      read-only options.

       -t     Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
	      addition	to  renaming  the  file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action.

       -T     Only set the file timestamp according to the Exif  create  time-
	      stamp,  do  not  rename  the file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action. Note:  On  Windows  you  may
	      have  to set the TZ environment variable for this option to work
	      correctly.

       -f     Do not prompt before overwriting	existing  files  (force  over-
	      write).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1'
	      ('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.

       -a time
	      Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]].  This  option  is
	      only  used  with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds one hour,
	      1:01 adds one hour and one minute, -0:00:30  subtracts  30  sec-
	      onds.

       -Y yrs Time  adjustment	by a positive or negative number of years, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -O mon Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of months,  for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -D day Time  adjustment	by  a positive or negative number of days, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -p mode
	      Print mode for the 'print' action. Possible modes are:
	      s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
	      a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
	      e : print Exif metadata (shortcut for -PEkycv)
	      t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
	      v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
	      h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
	      i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
	      x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
	      c : JPEG comment
	      p : list available image previews, sorted by preview image  size
	      in pixels
	      C  :  print  image  ICC  Profile (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2
	      only)
	      R : print image structure recursively  (jpg,  png,  tiff,  webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      S  :  print  image  structure information (jpg, png, tiff, webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      X : print "raw" XMP (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2 only)

       -P flgs
	      Print flags for fine control of the tag list  ('print'  action).
	      Allows  control  of the type of metadata as well as data columns
	      included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
	      E : include Exif tags in the list
	      I : IPTC datasets
	      X : XMP properties
	      x : print a column with the tag number
	      g : group name
	      k : key
	      l : tag label
	      n : tag name
	      y : type
	      c : number of components (count)
	      s : size in bytes
	      v : plain data value (vanilla values)
	      V : plain data value AND the word 'set '	(for  use  with  exiv2
	      -m-)
	      t : interpreted (translated) human readable data
	      h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the 'delete' action. Possible targets are:
	      a : all supported metadata (the default)
	      e : Exif section
	      t : Exif thumbnail only
	      i : IPTC data
	      x : XMP packet
	      c : JPEG comment
	      C : ICC Profile
	      I : All IPTC data

       -i tgt Insert  target(s)  for the 'insert' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus an optional modifier:

	      X : Insert metadata from an XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  insert targets determine what metadata to insert from
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default  is  all of these. Note that the inserted XMP properties
	      include those converted to Exif and IPTC.

	      XX: Insert "raw" XMP metadata from a sidecar (see option -pX)

	      - : Read from stdin.  This option is intended for "filter" oper-
	      ations such as:
	      $  exiv2 -e{tgt}- filename | xmllint .... | exiv2 -i{tgt}- file-
	      name

	      Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF thumbnails),  and
	      must be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus a  target  to  extract
	      preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
	      p[&ltn&gt[,&ltm&gt  ...]]  :  Extract preview images. The optional comma
	      separated list of preview image numbers  is  used  to  determine
	      which  preview  images  to extract. The available preview images
	      and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.

	      C : Extract embedded ICC profile to &ltfile&gt.icc

	      X : Extract metadata to an  XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  extract targets determine what metadata to extract to
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default is all of these.

	      XX: Extract "raw" XMP metadata to a sidecar (see -pX)
		  You  may  not  use  modify commands with the -eXX option and
	      only XMP is written to the sidecar.

	      - : Output to stdout (see -i tgt for an example of this feature)


       -r fmt Filename	format for the 'rename' action. The format string fol-
	      lows strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:

	      :basename:     original filename without extension
	      :dirname:      name of the directory holding the original file
	      :parentname:   name of parent directory
	      Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG comment string to set in the image ('modify' action).  This
	      option  can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions
	      to modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
	      Command file for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  -m- represents standard-input.

       -M cmd Command line for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  The format for the commands is the same as that  of
	      the lines of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
	      Use suffix .suf for source files in 'insert' action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

	  exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

	  exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined, and a non-
       standard XMP namespace registered.

	  exiv2 -M"reg myprefix http://ns.myprefix.me/" -M"add Xmp.myprefix.Whom Mr. Smith" -M"set Exif.Image.Artist Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and	values
       different  from	those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to read all
       metadata  that  it can write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key or add  the
	      tag.

       add    Add a tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre-
	      vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined  |  SShort  |
	      SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
	      String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
	      XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

	      A  default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default
	      is determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It  can  optionally
	      be   enclosed  in  single  quotes  ('value')  or	double	quotes
	      ("value").

	      The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent  to
	      an  empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array
	      property, e.g., a bag.

	      The format of Exif Comment values includes an  optional  charset
	      specification at the beginning:
	      [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

	      Undefined  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
	      charset definition.

	      The format for an IPTC Date value is:

		  YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day)

	      The format for an IPTC Time value is:

		  HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds)

	      and may optionally be followed by:

		 -HH:MM or +HH:MM (hours, minutes ahead/behind UTC)

	      The format of Rational (and SRational) is one of:

		 integer | integer/integer | Fnumber | number

	      Rational Examples:

	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue 557429/62500" X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue F5.6" X.jpg

	      The Rational format Fnumber is for the  convenience  of  setting
	      aperture	values.  Aperture values are stored in Exif is an APEX
	      value which can be evaluated by the expression:

	      apex-value  =    log(Fnumber) * 2.0 / log(2.0)
	      number	  = exp(apex-value * log(2.0) / 2.0)

	      The Rational format Fnumber is valid for any Rational, even when
	      the  key	is not an Aperture.  More information about APEX value
	      is available from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX_system

	      The format of XMP LangAlt values includes an  optional  language
	      qualifier:
	      lang="language-code" text

	      lang="x-default"	is used if the value doesn't start with a lan-
	      guage qualifier.

	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="de-DE" Euros' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-GB" Pounds' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US" In God We Trust' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title All others pay cash' X.jpg

	      To remove a language specification, set the value to  ''	(empty
	      string)
	      exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US"' X.jpg
	      To remove all language specifications, delete the key:
	      $ exiv2 -M'del Xmp.dc.title' X.jpg
	      To register additional XMP namespaces, combine the command with:
	      reg prefix namespace

   Command file format
       Empty lines and lines starting with # in a  command  file  are  ignored
       (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

EXAMPLES
       exiv2 *.jpg
	      Prints  a  summary of the Exif information for all JPEG files in
	      the directory.

       exiv2 -pi image.jpg
	      Prints the IPTC metadata of the image.

       exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames  img_1234.jpg  (taken  on  13-Nov-05  at	22:58:31)   to
	      20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Extracts	 the   Exif   thumbnails   from  the  two  files  into
	      img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Inserts (copies) metadata from img1.exv  to  img1.jpg  and  from
	      img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
	      Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
	      view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
	      Extracts IPTC datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
	      the process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
	      Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp
	      into image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted  from
	      the "IPTC Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the
	      older IPTC IIM4 format.  The  inserted  XMP  properties  include
	      those in the "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2  -M"set  Exif.Photo.UserComment  charset=Ascii  New Exif comment"
       image.jpg
	      Sets the Exif comment to an ASCII string.

       exiv2   -M"set	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude   4/1	15/1  33/1"  \	-M"set
       Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
	      Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north.
	      The Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude  tag  consists
	      of  three  Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds
	      of the latitude and GPSLatitudeRef contains either  'N'  or  'S'
	      for north or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
	      Copy  all  metadata  from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG
	      files with corresponding basenames in the /data directory.  Note
	      that  this  copies  metadata as is, without any modifications to
	      adapt it to the requirements of the  target  format.  Some  tags
	      copied like this may not make sense in the target image.

NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2 is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC, XMP metadata and image
       comments and can read many vendor makernote tags. The  program  option-
       ally  converts  between	Exif tags, XMP properties and IPTC datasets as
       recommended by the Exif Standard, the IPTC Standard, the XMP specifica-
       tion and Metadata Working Group guidelines.
       The following image formats are supported:

       Type   Exif	   IPTC 	XMP	     Image Comments	     ICC Profile
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       JPEG   Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   Read/Write 	     Read/Write

       JP2    Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   -			     Read/Write

       o Support  for  GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
	 recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height	and  width  of
	 the image are determined.

       o Reading  other  TIFF-like  RAW image formats, which are not listed in
	 the table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The action argument is only required  if  it  is  not  clear  from  the
       options which action is implied.

       pr | print
	      Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the com-
	      mand exiv2 image.jpg will print a  summary  of  the  image  Exif
	      metadata.

       ex | extract
	      Extract  metadata  to  *.exv,  XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail
	      image files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
	      Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv,  XMP  sidecar  (*.xmp)
	      and thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix of
	      the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used
	      as  input  files,  this command can be used to copy the metadata
	      between files of different formats. Modification commands can be
	      applied on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
	      Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
	      Adjust  Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one
	      of the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
	      Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif,  IPTC  and
	      XMP metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
	      Rename  files  and/or  set file timestamps according to the Exif
	      create timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOrig-
	      inal  or,  if  not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the
	      timestamp. The filename format can be set with -r fmt, timestamp
	      options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
	      Copy  the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
	      makernote   ISO	tags   to   the   regular   Exif   ISO	  tag,
	      Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing stan-
	      dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
	      Fix the  character  encoding  of	Exif  Unicode  user  comments.
	      Decodes the comment using the auto-detected or specified charac-
	      ter encoding and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to spec-
	      ify the current encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.
	      When -V is combined with -v (Verbose version), build information
	      is printed to standard  output  along  with  a  list  of	shared
	      libraries which have been loaded into memory. Verbose version is
	      supported on Windows (MSVC, Cygwin and MinGW builds), MacOSX and
	      Linux and is provided for test and debugging.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence  warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library dur-
	      ing the program run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can  be
	      used at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
	      or 'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. -Qm is equivalent  to
	      -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show  unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't have
	      a name).

       -g key Only keys which match the given key (grep).
	      Multiple -g options can be used to grep info for	several  keys.
	      When  the  library  is  build with C++11, keys are matched using
	      std::regex::extended.  When build without C++11, keys  are  pro-
	      cessed  with  the  system  regular expression engine:  see man 3
	      regex.  Platforms which do not support regex use key for a  sub-
	      string match.  You can determine the availability of regex using
	      the command: exiv2 -v -V -g have_regex -g cplusplus.

	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

	      -g (--grep) is only  applied  to	keys.	It  is	not  generally
	      applied to all output such as the default -ps report.

	      The  key	may  finish with the optional modifier /i to indicated
	      case insensitive.

       -K key Only report data for given key.
	      Multiple -K options can be used to report  more  than  a	single
	      key.

       -n enc Charset  to  use	to decode Exif Unicode user comments. enc is a
	      name understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.

       -k     Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
	      with  all  options  which  update  files. The flag is ignored by
	      read-only options.

       -t     Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
	      addition	to  renaming  the  file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action.

       -T     Only set the file timestamp according to the Exif  create  time-
	      stamp,  do  not  rename  the file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action. Note:  On  Windows  you  may
	      have  to set the TZ environment variable for this option to work
	      correctly.

       -f     Do not prompt before overwriting	existing  files  (force  over-
	      write).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1'
	      ('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.

       -a time
	      Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]].  This  option  is
	      only  used  with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds one hour,
	      1:01 adds one hour and one minute, -0:00:30  subtracts  30  sec-
	      onds.

       -Y yrs Time  adjustment	by a positive or negative number of years, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -O mon Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of months,  for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -D day Time  adjustment	by  a positive or negative number of days, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -p mode
	      Print mode for the 'print' action. Possible modes are:
	      s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
	      a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
	      e : print Exif metadata (shortcut for -PEkycv)
	      t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
	      v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
	      h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
	      i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
	      x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
	      c : JPEG comment
	      p : list available image previews, sorted by preview image  size
	      in pixels
	      C  :  print  image  ICC  Profile (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2
	      only)
	      R : print image structure recursively  (jpg,  png,  tiff,  webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      S  :  print  image  structure information (jpg, png, tiff, webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      X : print "raw" XMP (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2 only)

       -P flgs
	      Print flags for fine control of the tag list  ('print'  action).
	      Allows  control  of the type of metadata as well as data columns
	      included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
	      E : include Exif tags in the list
	      I : IPTC datasets
	      X : XMP properties
	      x : print a column with the tag number
	      g : group name
	      k : key
	      l : tag label
	      n : tag name
	      y : type
	      c : number of components (count)
	      s : size in bytes
	      v : plain data value (vanilla values)
	      V : plain data value AND the word 'set '	(for  use  with  exiv2
	      -m-)
	      t : interpreted (translated) human readable data
	      h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the 'delete' action. Possible targets are:
	      a : all supported metadata (the default)
	      e : Exif section
	      t : Exif thumbnail only
	      i : IPTC data
	      x : XMP packet
	      c : JPEG comment
	      C : ICC Profile
	      I : All IPTC data

       -i tgt Insert  target(s)  for the 'insert' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus an optional modifier:

	      X : Insert metadata from an XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  insert targets determine what metadata to insert from
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default  is  all of these. Note that the inserted XMP properties
	      include those converted to Exif and IPTC.

	      XX: Insert "raw" XMP metadata from a sidecar (see option -pX)

	      - : Read from stdin.  This option is intended for "filter" oper-
	      ations such as:
	      $  exiv2 -e{tgt}- filename | xmllint .... | exiv2 -i{tgt}- file-
	      name

	      Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF thumbnails),  and
	      must be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus a  target  to  extract
	      preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
	      p[&ltn&gt[,&ltm&gt  ...]]  :  Extract preview images. The optional comma
	      separated list of preview image numbers  is  used  to  determine
	      which  preview  images  to extract. The available preview images
	      and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.

	      C : Extract embedded ICC profile to &ltfile&gt.icc

	      X : Extract metadata to an  XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  extract targets determine what metadata to extract to
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default is all of these.

	      XX: Extract "raw" XMP metadata to a sidecar (see -pX)
		  You  may  not  use  modify commands with the -eXX option and
	      only XMP is written to the sidecar.

	      - : Output to stdout (see -i tgt for an example of this feature)


       -r fmt Filename	format for the 'rename' action. The format string fol-
	      lows strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:

	      :basename:     original filename without extension
	      :dirname:      name of the directory holding the original file
	      :parentname:   name of parent directory
	      Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG comment string to set in the image ('modify' action).  This
	      option  can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions
	      to modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
	      Command file for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  -m- represents standard-input.

       -M cmd Command line for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  The format for the commands is the same as that  of
	      the lines of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
	      Use suffix .suf for source files in 'insert' action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

	  exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

	  exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined, and a non-
       standard XMP namespace registered.

	  exiv2 -M"reg myprefix http://ns.myprefix.me/" -M"add Xmp.myprefix.Whom Mr. Smith" -M"set Exif.Image.Artist Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and	values
       different  from	those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to read all
       metadata  that  it can write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key or add  the
	      tag.

       add    Add a tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre-
	      vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined  |  SShort  |
	      SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
	      String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
	      XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

	      A  default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default
	      is determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It  can  optionally
	      be   enclosed  in  single  quotes  ('value')  or	double	quotes
	      ("value").

	      The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent  to
	      an  empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array
	      property, e.g., a bag.

	      The format of Exif Comment values includes an  optional  charset
	      specification at the beginning:
	      [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

	      Undefined  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
	      charset definition.

	      The format for an IPTC Date value is:

		  YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day)

	      The format for an IPTC Time value is:

		  HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds)

	      and may optionally be followed by:

		 -HH:MM or +HH:MM (hours, minutes ahead/behind UTC)

	      The format of Rational (and SRational) is one of:

		 integer | integer/integer | Fnumber | number

	      Rational Examples:

	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue 557429/62500" X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue F5.6" X.jpg

	      The Rational format Fnumber is for the  convenience  of  setting
	      aperture	values.  Aperture values are stored in Exif is an APEX
	      value which can be evaluated by the expression:

	      apex-value  =    log(Fnumber) * 2.0 / log(2.0)
	      number	  = exp(apex-value * log(2.0) / 2.0)

	      The Rational format Fnumber is valid for any Rational, even when
	      the  key	is not an Aperture.  More information about APEX value
	      is available from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX_system

	      The format of XMP LangAlt values includes an  optional  language
	      qualifier:
	      lang="language-code" text

	      lang="x-default"	is used if the value doesn't start with a lan-
	      guage qualifier.

	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="de-DE" Euros' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-GB" Pounds' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US" In God We Trust' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title All others pay cash' X.jpg

	      To remove a language specification, set the value to  ''	(empty
	      string)
	      exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US"' X.jpg
	      To remove all language specifications, delete the key:
	      $ exiv2 -M'del Xmp.dc.title' X.jpg
	      To register additional XMP namespaces, combine the command with:
	      reg prefix namespace

   Command file format
       Empty lines and lines starting with # in a  command  file  are  ignored
       (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

EXAMPLES
       exiv2 *.jpg
	      Prints  a  summary of the Exif information for all JPEG files in
	      the directory.

       exiv2 -pi image.jpg
	      Prints the IPTC metadata of the image.

       exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames  img_1234.jpg  (taken  on  13-Nov-05  at	22:58:31)   to
	      20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Extracts	 the   Exif   thumbnails   from  the  two  files  into
	      img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Inserts (copies) metadata from img1.exv  to  img1.jpg  and  from
	      img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
	      Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
	      view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
	      Extracts IPTC datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
	      the process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
	      Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp
	      into image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted  from
	      the "IPTC Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the
	      older IPTC IIM4 format.  The  inserted  XMP  properties  include
	      those in the "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2  -M"set  Exif.Photo.UserComment  charset=Ascii  New Exif comment"
       image.jpg
	      Sets the Exif comment to an ASCII string.

       exiv2   -M"set	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude   4/1	15/1  33/1"  \	-M"set
       Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
	      Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north.
	      The Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude  tag  consists
	      of  three  Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds
	      of the latitude and GPSLatitudeRef contains either  'N'  or  'S'
	      for north or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
	      Copy  all  metadata  from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG
	      files with corresponding basenames in the /data directory.  Note
	      that  this  copies  metadata as is, without any modifications to
	      adapt it to the requirements of the  target  format.  Some  tags
	      copied like this may not make sense in the target image.

NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2 is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC, XMP metadata and image
       comments and can read many vendor makernote tags. The  program  option-
       ally  converts  between	Exif tags, XMP properties and IPTC datasets as
       recommended by the Exif Standard, the IPTC Standard, the XMP specifica-
       tion and Metadata Working Group guidelines.
       The following image formats are supported:

       Type   Exif	   IPTC 	XMP	     Image Comments	     ICC Profile
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       JP2    Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   -			     Read/Write

       o Support  for  GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
	 recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height	and  width  of
	 the image are determined.

       o Reading  other  TIFF-like  RAW image formats, which are not listed in
	 the table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The action argument is only required  if  it  is  not  clear  from  the
       options which action is implied.

       pr | print
	      Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the com-
	      mand exiv2 image.jpg will print a  summary  of  the  image  Exif
	      metadata.

       ex | extract
	      Extract  metadata  to  *.exv,  XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail
	      image files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
	      Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv,  XMP  sidecar  (*.xmp)
	      and thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix of
	      the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used
	      as  input  files,  this command can be used to copy the metadata
	      between files of different formats. Modification commands can be
	      applied on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
	      Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
	      Adjust  Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one
	      of the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
	      Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif,  IPTC  and
	      XMP metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
	      Rename  files  and/or  set file timestamps according to the Exif
	      create timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOrig-
	      inal  or,  if  not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the
	      timestamp. The filename format can be set with -r fmt, timestamp
	      options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
	      Copy  the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
	      makernote   ISO	tags   to   the   regular   Exif   ISO	  tag,
	      Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing stan-
	      dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
	      Fix the  character  encoding  of	Exif  Unicode  user  comments.
	      Decodes the comment using the auto-detected or specified charac-
	      ter encoding and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to spec-
	      ify the current encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.
	      When -V is combined with -v (Verbose version), build information
	      is printed to standard  output  along  with  a  list  of	shared
	      libraries which have been loaded into memory. Verbose version is
	      supported on Windows (MSVC, Cygwin and MinGW builds), MacOSX and
	      Linux and is provided for test and debugging.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence  warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library dur-
	      ing the program run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can  be
	      used at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
	      or 'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. -Qm is equivalent  to
	      -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show  unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't have
	      a name).

       -g key Only keys which match the given key (grep).
	      Multiple -g options can be used to grep info for	several  keys.
	      When  the  library  is  build with C++11, keys are matched using
	      std::regex::extended.  When build without C++11, keys  are  pro-
	      cessed  with  the  system  regular expression engine:  see man 3
	      regex.  Platforms which do not support regex use key for a  sub-
	      string match.  You can determine the availability of regex using
	      the command: exiv2 -v -V -g have_regex -g cplusplus.

	      exiv2 -g Date -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Image.DateTime	    Ascii      20  2012:08:07 16:01:05
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

	      -g (--grep) is only  applied  to	keys.	It  is	not  generally
	      applied to all output such as the default -ps report.

	      The  key	may  finish with the optional modifier /i to indicated
	      case insensitive.

       -K key Only report data for given key.
	      Multiple -K options can be used to report  more  than  a	single
	      key.

	      exiv2 -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

       -n enc Charset  to  use	to decode Exif Unicode user comments. enc is a
	      name understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.

       -k     Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
	      with  all  options  which  update  files. The flag is ignored by
	      read-only options.

       -t     Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
	      addition	to  renaming  the  file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action.

       -T     Only set the file timestamp according to the Exif  create  time-
	      stamp,  do  not  rename  the file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action. Note:  On  Windows  you  may
	      have  to set the TZ environment variable for this option to work
	      correctly.

       -f     Do not prompt before overwriting	existing  files  (force  over-
	      write).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1'
	      ('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.

       -a time
	      Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]].  This  option  is
	      only  used  with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds one hour,
	      1:01 adds one hour and one minute, -0:00:30  subtracts  30  sec-
	      onds.

       -Y yrs Time  adjustment	by a positive or negative number of years, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -O mon Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of months,  for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -D day Time  adjustment	by  a positive or negative number of days, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -p mode
	      Print mode for the 'print' action. Possible modes are:
	      s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
	      a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
	      e : print Exif metadata (shortcut for -PEkycv)
	      t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
	      v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
	      h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
	      i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
	      x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
	      c : JPEG comment
	      p : list available image previews, sorted by preview image  size
	      in pixels
	      C  :  print  image  ICC  Profile (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2
	      only)
	      R : print image structure recursively  (jpg,  png,  tiff,  webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      S  :  print  image  structure information (jpg, png, tiff, webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      X : print "raw" XMP (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2 only)

       -P flgs
	      Print flags for fine control of the tag list  ('print'  action).
	      Allows  control  of the type of metadata as well as data columns
	      included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
	      E : include Exif tags in the list
	      I : IPTC datasets
	      X : XMP properties
	      x : print a column with the tag number
	      g : group name
	      k : key
	      l : tag label
	      n : tag name
	      y : type
	      c : number of components (count)
	      s : size in bytes
	      v : plain data value (vanilla values)
	      V : plain data value AND the word 'set '	(for  use  with  exiv2
	      -m-)
	      t : interpreted (translated) human readable data
	      h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the 'delete' action. Possible targets are:
	      a : all supported metadata (the default)
	      e : Exif section
	      t : Exif thumbnail only
	      i : IPTC data
	      x : XMP packet
	      c : JPEG comment
	      C : ICC Profile
	      I : All IPTC data

       -i tgt Insert  target(s)  for the 'insert' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus an optional modifier:

	      X : Insert metadata from an XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  insert targets determine what metadata to insert from
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default  is  all of these. Note that the inserted XMP properties
	      include those converted to Exif and IPTC.

	      XX: Insert "raw" XMP metadata from a sidecar (see option -pX)

	      - : Read from stdin.  This option is intended for "filter" oper-
	      ations such as:
	      $  exiv2 -e{tgt}- filename | xmllint .... | exiv2 -i{tgt}- file-
	      name

	      Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF thumbnails),  and
	      must be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus a  target  to  extract
	      preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
	      p[&ltn&gt[,&ltm&gt  ...]]  :  Extract preview images. The optional comma
	      separated list of preview image numbers  is  used  to  determine
	      which  preview  images  to extract. The available preview images
	      and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.

	      C : Extract embedded ICC profile to &ltfile&gt.icc

	      X : Extract metadata to an  XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  extract targets determine what metadata to extract to
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default is all of these.

	      XX: Extract "raw" XMP metadata to a sidecar (see -pX)
		  You  may  not  use  modify commands with the -eXX option and
	      only XMP is written to the sidecar.

	      - : Output to stdout (see -i tgt for an example of this feature)


       -r fmt Filename	format for the 'rename' action. The format string fol-
	      lows strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:

	      :basename:     original filename without extension
	      :dirname:      name of the directory holding the original file
	      :parentname:   name of parent directory
	      Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG comment string to set in the image ('modify' action).  This
	      option  can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions
	      to modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
	      Command file for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  -m- represents standard-input.

       -M cmd Command line for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  The format for the commands is the same as that  of
	      the lines of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
	      Use suffix .suf for source files in 'insert' action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

	  exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

	  exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined, and a non-
       standard XMP namespace registered.

	  exiv2 -M"reg myprefix http://ns.myprefix.me/" -M"add Xmp.myprefix.Whom Mr. Smith" -M"set Exif.Image.Artist Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and	values
       different  from	those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to read all
       metadata  that  it can write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key or add  the
	      tag.

       add    Add a tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre-
	      vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined  |  SShort  |
	      SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
	      String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
	      XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

	      A  default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default
	      is determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It  can  optionally
	      be   enclosed  in  single  quotes  ('value')  or	double	quotes
	      ("value").

	      The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent  to
	      an  empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array
	      property, e.g., a bag.

	      The format of Exif Comment values includes an  optional  charset
	      specification at the beginning:
	      [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

	      Undefined  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
	      charset definition.

	      The format for an IPTC Date value is:

		  YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day)

	      The format for an IPTC Time value is:

		  HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds)

	      and may optionally be followed by:

		 -HH:MM or +HH:MM (hours, minutes ahead/behind UTC)

	      The format of Rational (and SRational) is one of:

		 integer | integer/integer | Fnumber | number

	      Rational Examples:

	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue 557429/62500" X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue F5.6" X.jpg

	      The Rational format Fnumber is for the  convenience  of  setting
	      aperture	values.  Aperture values are stored in Exif is an APEX
	      value which can be evaluated by the expression:

	      apex-value  =    log(Fnumber) * 2.0 / log(2.0)
	      number	  = exp(apex-value * log(2.0) / 2.0)

	      The Rational format Fnumber is valid for any Rational, even when
	      the  key	is not an Aperture.  More information about APEX value
	      is available from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX_system

	      The format of XMP LangAlt values includes an  optional  language
	      qualifier:
	      lang="language-code" text

	      lang="x-default"	is used if the value doesn't start with a lan-
	      guage qualifier.

	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="de-DE" Euros' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-GB" Pounds' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US" In God We Trust' X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title All others pay cash' X.jpg

	      To remove a language specification, set the value to  ''	(empty
	      string)
	      exiv2 -M'set Xmp.dc.title lang="en-US"' X.jpg
	      To remove all language specifications, delete the key:
	      $ exiv2 -M'del Xmp.dc.title' X.jpg
	      To register additional XMP namespaces, combine the command with:
	      reg prefix namespace

   Command file format
       Empty lines and lines starting with # in a  command  file  are  ignored
       (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

EXAMPLES
       exiv2 *.jpg
	      Prints  a  summary of the Exif information for all JPEG files in
	      the directory.

       exiv2 -pi image.jpg
	      Prints the IPTC metadata of the image.

       exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames  img_1234.jpg  (taken  on  13-Nov-05  at	22:58:31)   to
	      20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Extracts	 the   Exif   thumbnails   from  the  two  files  into
	      img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Inserts (copies) metadata from img1.exv  to  img1.jpg  and  from
	      img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
	      Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
	      view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
	      Extracts IPTC datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
	      the process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
	      Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp
	      into image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted  from
	      the "IPTC Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the
	      older IPTC IIM4 format.  The  inserted  XMP  properties  include
	      those in the "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2  -M"set  Exif.Photo.UserComment  charset=Ascii  New Exif comment"
       image.jpg
	      Sets the Exif comment to an ASCII string.

       exiv2   -M"set	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude   4/1	15/1  33/1"  \	-M"set
       Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
	      Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north.
	      The Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude  tag  consists
	      of  three  Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds
	      of the latitude and GPSLatitudeRef contains either  'N'  or  'S'
	      for north or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
	      Copy  all  metadata  from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG
	      files with corresponding basenames in the /data directory.  Note
	      that  this  copies  metadata as is, without any modifications to
	      adapt it to the requirements of the  target  format.  Some  tags
	      copied like this may not make sense in the target image.

NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2 is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC, XMP metadata and image
       comments and can read many vendor makernote tags. The  program  option-
       ally  converts  between	Exif tags, XMP properties and IPTC datasets as
       recommended by the Exif Standard, the IPTC Standard, the XMP specifica-
       tion and Metadata Working Group guidelines.
       The following image formats are supported:

       Type   Exif	   IPTC 	XMP	     Image Comments	     ICC Profile
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       JPEG   Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   Read/Write 	     Read/Write
       EXV    Read/Write   Read/Write	Read/Write   Read/Write Read/Write

       o Support  for  GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image format is
	 recognized, a MIME type assigned to it and the height	and  width  of
	 the image are determined.

       o Reading  other  TIFF-like  RAW image formats, which are not listed in
	 the table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The action argument is only required  if  it  is  not  clear  from  the
       options which action is implied.

       pr | print
	      Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the com-
	      mand exiv2 image.jpg will print a  summary  of  the  image  Exif
	      metadata.

       ex | extract
	      Extract  metadata  to  *.exv,  XMP sidecar (*.xmp) and thumbnail
	      image files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
	      Insert metadata from corresponding *.exv,  XMP  sidecar  (*.xmp)
	      and thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix of
	      the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used
	      as  input  files,  this command can be used to copy the metadata
	      between files of different formats. Modification commands can be
	      applied on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
	      Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
	      Adjust  Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least one
	      of the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
	      Apply commands to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif,  IPTC  and
	      XMP metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
	      Rename  files  and/or  set file timestamps according to the Exif
	      create timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOrig-
	      inal  or,  if  not present, Exif.Image.DateTime to determine the
	      timestamp. The filename format can be set with -r fmt, timestamp
	      options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
	      Copy  the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or Canon
	      makernote   ISO	tags   to   the   regular   Exif   ISO	  tag,
	      Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing stan-
	      dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
	      Fix the  character  encoding  of	Exif  Unicode  user  comments.
	      Decodes the comment using the auto-detected or specified charac-
	      ter encoding and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to spec-
	      ify the current encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.
	      When -V is combined with -v (Verbose version), build information
	      is printed to standard  output  along  with  a  list  of	shared
	      libraries which have been loaded into memory. Verbose version is
	      supported on Windows (MSVC, Cygwin and MinGW builds), MacOSX and
	      Linux and is provided for test and debugging.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence  warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library dur-
	      ing the program run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can  be
	      used at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
	      or 'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. -Qm is equivalent  to
	      -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show  unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't have
	      a name).

       -g key Only keys which match the given key (grep).
	      Multiple -g options can be used to grep info for	several  keys.
	      When  the  library  is  build with C++11, keys are matched using
	      std::regex::extended.  When build without C++11, keys  are  pro-
	      cessed  with  the  system  regular expression engine:  see man 3
	      regex.  Platforms which do not support regex use key for a  sub-
	      string match.  You can determine the availability of regex using
	      the command: exiv2 -v -V -g have_regex -g cplusplus.

	      exiv2 -g Date -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Image.DateTime	    Ascii      20  2012:08:07 16:01:05
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

	      -g (--grep) is only  applied  to	keys.	It  is	not  generally
	      applied to all output such as the default -ps report.

	      The  key	may  finish with the optional modifier /i to indicated
	      case insensitive.

       -K key Only report data for given key.
	      Multiple -K options can be used to report  more  than  a	single
	      key.

	      exiv2 -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized -K Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal -pt R.jpg
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal   Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48
	      Exif.Photo.DateTimeDigitized  Ascii      20  2011:09:18 16:25:48

       -n enc Charset  to  use	to decode Exif Unicode user comments. enc is a
	      name understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.

       -k     Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
	      with  all  options  which  update  files. The flag is ignored by
	      read-only options.

       -t     Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
	      addition	to  renaming  the  file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action.

       -T     Only set the file timestamp according to the Exif  create  time-
	      stamp,  do  not  rename  the file (overrides -k). This option is
	      only used with the 'rename' action. Note:  On  Windows  you  may
	      have  to set the TZ environment variable for this option to work
	      correctly.

       -f     Do not prompt before overwriting	existing  files  (force  over-
	      write).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1'
	      ('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.

       -a time
	      Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]].  This  option  is
	      only  used  with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds one hour,
	      1:01 adds one hour and one minute, -0:00:30  subtracts  30  sec-
	      onds.

       -Y yrs Time  adjustment	by a positive or negative number of years, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -O mon Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of months,  for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -D day Time  adjustment	by  a positive or negative number of days, for
	      the 'adjust' action.

       -p mode
	      Print mode for the 'print' action. Possible modes are:
	      s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
	      a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
	      e : print Exif metadata (shortcut for -PEkycv)
	      t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
	      v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
	      h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
	      i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
	      x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
	      c : JPEG comment
	      p : list available image previews, sorted by preview image  size
	      in pixels
	      C  :  print  image  ICC  Profile (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2
	      only)
	      R : print image structure recursively  (jpg,  png,  tiff,  webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      S  :  print  image  structure information (jpg, png, tiff, webp,
	      cr2, jp2 only)
	      X : print "raw" XMP (jpg, png, tiff, webp, cr2, jp2 only)

       -P flgs
	      Print flags for fine control of the tag list  ('print'  action).
	      Allows  control  of the type of metadata as well as data columns
	      included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
	      E : include Exif tags in the list
	      I : IPTC datasets
	      X : XMP properties
	      x : print a column with the tag number
	      g : group name
	      k : key
	      l : tag label
	      n : tag name
	      y : type
	      c : number of components (count)
	      s : size in bytes
	      v : plain data value (vanilla values)
	      V : plain data value AND the word 'set '	(for  use  with  exiv2
	      -m-)
	      t : interpreted (translated) human readable data
	      h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the 'delete' action. Possible targets are:
	      a : all supported metadata (the default)
	      e : Exif section
	      t : Exif thumbnail only
	      i : IPTC data
	      x : XMP packet
	      c : JPEG comment
	      C : ICC Profile
	      I : All IPTC data

       -i tgt Insert  target(s)  for the 'insert' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus an optional modifier:

	      X : Insert metadata from an XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  insert targets determine what metadata to insert from
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default  is  all of these. Note that the inserted XMP properties
	      include those converted to Exif and IPTC.

	      XX: Insert "raw" XMP metadata from a sidecar (see option -pX)

	      - : Read from stdin.  This option is intended for "filter" oper-
	      ations such as:
	      $  exiv2 -e{tgt}- filename | xmllint .... | exiv2 -i{tgt}- file-
	      name

	      Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF thumbnails),  and
	      must be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are
	      the same as those for the -d option, plus a  target  to  extract
	      preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
	      p[&ltn&gt[,&ltm&gt  ...]]  :  Extract preview images. The optional comma
	      separated list of preview image numbers  is  used  to  determine
	      which  preview  images  to extract. The available preview images
	      and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.

	      C : Extract embedded ICC profile to &ltfile&gt.icc

	      X : Extract metadata to an  XMP  sidecar	file  &ltfile&gt.xmp.  The
	      remaining  extract targets determine what metadata to extract to
	      the sidecar file. Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and  XMP  and  the
	      default is all of these.

	      XX: Extract "raw" XMP metadata to a sidecar (see -pX)
		  You  may  not  use  modify commands with the -eXX option and
	      only XMP is written to the sidecar.

	      - : Output to stdout (see -i tgt for an example of this feature)


       -r fmt Filename	format for the 'rename' action. The format string fol-
	      lows strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:

	      :basename:     original filename without extension
	      :dirname:      name of the directory holding the original file
	      :parentname:   name of parent directory
	      Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG comment string to set in the image ('modify' action).  This
	      option  can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions
	      to modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
	      Command file for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  -m- represents standard-input.

       -M cmd Command line for the 'modify' action. This option  can  also  be
	      used  with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify metadata
	      on-the-fly.  The format for the commands is the same as that  of
	      the lines of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
	      Use suffix .suf for source files in 'insert' action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

	  exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

	  exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined, and a non-
       standard XMP namespace registered.

	  exiv2 -M"reg myprefix http://ns.myprefix.me/" -M"add Xmp.myprefix.Whom Mr. Smith" -M"set Exif.Image.Artist Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and	values
       different  from	those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to read all
       metadata  that  it can write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key or add  the
	      tag.

       add    Add a tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre-
	      vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined  |  SShort  |
	      SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
	      String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
	      XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

	      A  default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default
	      is determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It  can  optionally
	      be   enclosed  in  single  quotes  ('value')  or	double	quotes
	      ("value").

	      The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent  to
	      an  empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array
	      property, e.g., a bag.

	      The format of Exif Comment values includes an  optional  charset
	      specification at the beginning:
	      [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

	      Undefined  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
	      charset definition.

	      The format for an IPTC Date value is:

		  YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day)

	      The format for an IPTC Time value is:

		  HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds)

	      and may optionally be followed by:

		 -HH:MM or +HH:MM (hours, minutes ahead/behind UTC)

	      The format of Rational (and SRational) is one of:

		 integer | integer/integer | Fnumber | number

	      Rational Examples:

	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue 557429/62500" X.jpg
	      $ exiv2 "-Mset Exif.Photo.MaxApertureValue F5.6" X.jpg

	      The Rational format Fnumber is for the  convenience  of  setting
	      aperture	values.  Aperture values are stored in Exif is an APEX
	      value which can be evaluated by the expression:

	      apex-value  =    log(Fnumber) * 2.0 / log(2.0)
	      number	  = exp(apex-value * log(2.0) / 2.0)

	      The Rational format Fnumber is valid for any Rational, even when
	      the  key	is not an Aperture.  More information about APEX value
	      is available from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX_system

	      The format of XMP LangAlt values includes an  optional  language
	      qualifier:
	      lang="language-code" text

	      lang="x-default"	is used if the value doesn't start with a lan-

	      20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg
	      Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Extracts	 the   Exif   thumbnails   from  the  two  files  into
	      img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
	      Inserts (copies) metadata from img1.exv  to  img1.jpg  and  from
	      img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
	      Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
	      view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
	      Extracts IPTC datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
	      the process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
	      Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp
	      into image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted  from
	      the "IPTC Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the
	      older IPTC IIM4 format.  The  inserted  XMP  properties  include
	      those in the "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2  -M"set  Exif.Photo.UserComment  charset=Ascii  New Exif comment"

       exiv2   -M"set	Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude   4/1	15/1  33/1"  \	-M"set
       Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
	      Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north.
	      The Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude  tag  consists
	      of  three  Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds
	      of the latitude and GPSLatitudeRef contains either  'N'  or  'S'
	      for north or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
	      Copy  all  metadata  from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG
	      files with corresponding basenames in the /data directory.  Note
	      that  this  copies  metadata as is, without any modifications to
	      adapt it to the requirements of the  target  format.  Some  tags
	      copied like this may not make sense in the target image.
