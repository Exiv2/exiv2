<b><a name="item40">Exiv2 0.6.1 released</a></b><br>Bugfix: The Exif thumbnail is no more lost when Exif data is modified

<b><a name="item42">Exiv2 0.6 released</a></b><br>This is a maintenance release containing numerous smaller
   improvements and fixes. The Exiv2 utility now also deletes,
   extracts, and re-inserts IPTC data and Jpeg comments from/into Jpeg
   files. The library now supports creation of all Exif metadata from
   scratch, including makernote tags and thumbnails. In addition, Exif
   as well as IPTC metadata with unknown tag names can be added and
   manipulated just like known tags. See the <a title="Changelog" href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for more details.

   hosts the Exiv2 source code repository. He converted it from CVS to

<b><a name="item44">Exiv2 0.5 released</a></b><br>This release adds support for IPTC metadata. IPTC datasets can
   now be manipulated (read and written) similar to Exif metadata.
   In connection with the IPTC feature, the existing Metadatum Key and
   Value concept was enhanced and the Jpeg file access code was revamped.
   The exiv2 utility has a new print option to show the IPTC metadata of
   a Jpeg image.
   Also, this release adds a configure script and MSVC project files
   (but no libtool support yet).
   See the <a title="Changelog" href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for

<b><a name="item45">Exif keys changed</a></b><br>Starting with release 0.5 the keys used to identify
   <a title="Exif and MakerNote tags" href="metadata.html">Exif tags</a>
   are of the form '<i>Exif</i>.groupName.tagName' to be consistent
   with the new IPTC keys. Existing programs need to be updated
   accordingly. Since the old keys are plain C++ strings, the
   compiler cannot detect the change. However, it will tell you to use
   the new classes Key and ExifKey in the critical regions of the code.

<b><a name="item46">Exiv2 0.4 released</a></b><br>This release adds support for three different Nikon makernote
   formats to the library. The generalised IfdMakerNote interface can
   accomodate more makernote oddities and allows for programmatic
   detection of the makernote format. The library now knows how to
   deal with broken IFDs. The Exiv2 utility uses a more intuitive and
   less rigid command line parsing logic. See the <a title="Changelog" href="changelog.html">changelog</a>
