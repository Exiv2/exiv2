  <title>Exiv2 0.18 released</title>
  <abstract>It's official: Exiv2 writes to TIFF images.
  </abstract>
  <desc>Here is the final 0.18 release with write-support for TIFF,
   DNG, NEF, PEF, PNG and JP2 images, makernote updates and access to
   image previews. On Windows, Exiv2 can now be built as a DLL.<br />
   In addition to the changes in the 0.18 pre-releases, the Exiv2
   command line utility has new options to show all (Exif, IPTC and
   XMP) metadata and to list and extract preview images, while the
   library enhancements are mostly bug fixes and minor features. See

  <abstract>Windows DLL, image previews.
  </abstract>
  <desc>With this pre-release it is now possible to build an Exiv2 Windows
   DLL.<br />
   A new API was added to 
   <a title="" href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/exiv2/message/1404">access image previews</a>
   of any image. In addition to Exif thumbnails this allows retrieving
   various other previews from RAW images and Exif MakerNotes through
   a common interface.<br />
   Another backward-compatible API change allows 
   <a title="" href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/exiv2/message/1408">advanced Exif pretty-printing functions</a>
   to refer to all Exif tags.<br />
   Further Exif improvements and fixes are detailed in the
   <a title="ChangeLog" href="changelog.html">ChangeLog</a>.<br />
   Again, please use this pre-release to test with backups of your
   images and to adapt applications to the modified interface, and raise
   issues in the <a title="Exiv2 support forum" href="support.html">forum</a>.
   Your feedback is important to finalizing release 0.18.

  <title>Exiv2 0.18-pre1</title>
  <abstract>Write-support for TIFF, PNG and JP2 images.
  </abstract>
  <desc>This pre-release adds write-support for TIFF, DNG, NEF, PEF,
   PNG and JP2 images and provides the basis for write-support for
   other TIFF-like RAW formats.<br />
   The library's <a title="Exiv2 API documentation" href="doc/index.html">API</a>
   was streamlined and internal symbols removed from the ABI. The
   benefits of this change are manifold. In particular, the reduced
   API is easier to work with and will ultimately be more stable.<br />
   Under the hood, the TIFF parser code was consolidated: JPEG images
   now also use the new TIFF parser to read and write Exif metadata
   and the old obsolete code was removed.<br />
   See the <a title="ChangeLog" href="changelog.html">ChangeLog</a> for a
   complete list of changes and links to even more details.<br />
   Please use this pre-release to test with backups of your images and
   to adapt applications to the modified interface, and raise issues

  <desc>Completed Canon CRW support, tags can now also be written to Canon 
   CRW images. See the documentation for the list of Exif tags that can be

  <desc>The Canon RAW support is currently read-only. Canon THM is also
   supported, since that is the same as JPEG. Note that THM files contain 
   all the Exif stuff, CRW have only a few tags. Other improvements are 
   mostly bugfixes to make Exiv2 handle various (more or less) exceptional 
   situations more gracefully.<br />
   For application developers, there is a new precompiler define to
   suppress all output from the library and a small script,
   exiv2-config, to help with the compilation of your applications.<br />

   under which the company can use most of the Exiv2 library (except for
   the Nikon lens table and related code) in their proprietary products
   under terms which are different from those of the GPL.
   In return Vizrea will assign the copyright of their changes to me and
   contribute them back to the free version.<br />
   Therefore, if this deal is successful, the free version of Exiv2
   will benefit from the code contributed under the agreement. Since
   Brad, who wrote major portions of the existing library is with
   Vizrea, this will hopefully allow him to continue to spend time 
   adding good stuff to Exiv2.

  <title>Exiv2 0.7 released</title>
  <abstract>Design changes in the library, new Olympus, Panasonic and basic 
   Sony makernotes and updated Canon and Nikon makernotes.
  </abstract>
  <desc>The inside-out design change made class Exiv2::Image the
   top-level class of the library. This is the basis for support of
   other file formats (however, Exiv2 still only supports Jpeg for
   now). As a result, the C++ interface changed fundamentally in the
   way how metadata is accessed. Existing programs will need to be
   updated (see the examples). Thanks to the new I/O abstraction layer,
   it is now possible to access images in memory directly.<br />
   Additional makernotes from Olympus, Panasonic and Sony cameras
   are recognized and the Canon and Nikon makernotes have been updated.<br />
   Exif tags now have a default type, it works like the existing Iptc
   default type.<br />

   on various platforms, improved installation routine.<br />

  <title>Exiv2 0.6.1 released</title>
  <abstract>Fixes a bug that could lose the thumbnail when Exif
   tags were modified and adds metadata write support to the utility.
  </abstract>
  <desc>Bugfix: The Exif thumbnail is no more lost when Exif data is modified 
   in an "intrusive" manner, e.g., by adding new tags. This was a bug 
   introduced with release 0.6. <br/>
   Feature: The new modify option adds metadata write support to the Exiv2 
   utility. <br/>As usual, the

  <title>Exiv2 0.6 released</title>
  <abstract>More IPTC functions in the utility, library support for the 
   creation of all Exif metadata from scratch and more.
  </abstract>
  <desc>This is a maintenance release containing numerous smaller
   improvements and fixes. The Exiv2 utility now also deletes,
   extracts, and re-inserts IPTC data and Jpeg comments from/into Jpeg
   files. The library now supports creation of all Exif metadata from
   scratch, including makernote tags and thumbnails. In addition, Exif
   as well as IPTC metadata with unknown tag names can be added and
   manipulated just like known tags. See the <a title="Changelog"
   href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for more details.

  <title>Exiv2 0.5 released</title>
  <abstract>IPTC metadata read and write support, an autoconf configure 
   script, MSVC project files.
  </abstract>
  <desc>This release adds support for IPTC metadata. IPTC datasets can 
   now be manipulated (read and written) similar to Exif metadata.
   In connection with the IPTC feature, the existing Metadatum Key and 
   Value concept was enhanced and the Jpeg file access code was revamped.
   The exiv2 utility has a new print option to show the IPTC metadata of 
   a Jpeg image. 
   Also, this release adds a configure script and MSVC project files 
   (but no libtool support yet).

  <title>Exif keys changed</title>
  <abstract>With release 0.5 all Exif key values in existing applications
   need to be updated.
  </abstract>
  <desc>Starting with release 0.5 the keys used to identify 
   <a title="Exif and MakerNote tags" href="metadata.html">Exif tags</a> 
   are of the form '<i>Exif</i>.groupName.tagName' to be consistent 
   with the new IPTC keys. Existing programs need to be updated 
   accordingly. Since the old keys are plain C++ strings, the 
   compiler cannot detect the change. However, it will tell you to use
   the new classes Key and ExifKey in the critical regions of the code.

  <title>Exiv2 0.4 released</title>
  <abstract>Support for Nikon makernotes, improved handling of corrupt IFDs, 
   more intuitive command line parsing for the Exiv2 utility and more.
  </abstract>
  <desc>This release adds support for three different Nikon makernote
   formats to the library. The generalised IfdMakerNote interface can
   accomodate more makernote oddities and allows for programmatic
   detection of the makernote format. The library now knows how to
   deal with broken IFDs. The Exiv2 utility uses a more intuitive and 
   less rigid command line parsing logic. See the <a title="Changelog" 
   href="changelog.html">changelog</a> 
   for details.
