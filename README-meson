meson build system

This is a basic meson.build file intended to be used by meson projects that use
WrapDB: https://github.com/mesonbuild/wrapdb

This can also be used as a test playground to test various options not exposed
by the CMake build, eg: iconv and intl on Windows.

It is currently incomplete. Tests are not implemented yet. The library and
executable are.
