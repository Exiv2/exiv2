2   Puzzle with autotools/--with-adobe MacOS-X Only
Added   : 2017-08-17
Modified: 2017-08-18

The --with-adobe code is new (added on Monday/Tuesday 2017-08-15).
It's very much "Work in Progress" and will get lots more polishing.
This builds and links on Mac and Linux (Cygwin isn't ready yet).
Autotools isn't used with Visual Studio

Default build (which compile/links xmpsdk/src) is fine (and passes test suite)
$ sudo make distclean ; make config ; ./configure ; make ; sudo make install ; make samples ; make tests

Status: The 2016/AdobeXMPsdk requires an entry point that's not in the C++ STL library
        ./configure                   is building and passing the test suite
        ./configure --with-adobe=2014 is broken on __ZNSs4_Rep11_S_terminalE
        ./configure --with-adobe=2016 is broken on __ZNSiD0Ev

The missing entry points are in /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib
When I use install_name_tool to change to libstdc++.6.dylib, I crash in this:

$ c++filt __ZNSt3__112basic_stringIcNS_11char_traitsIcEENS_9allocatorIcEEED1Ev
std::__1::basic_string<char, std::__1::char_traits<char>, std::__1::allocator<char> >::~basic_string()
$

There's something mixed up concerning the libraries used by Adobe's XMPSDK and libexiv2.26.dylib
-stdlib=libstdc++ will link /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib, however the compiler warns:
clang: warning: libstdc++ is deprecated; move to libc++ [-Wdeprecated]

2.1 To build without the external Adobe SDK:
--------------------------------------------

Edit config/config.mk.in and modify:
   XMPSDK_LIBS= -lXMPCore
to
   XMPSDK_LIBS = ''

$ sudo make distclean ; make config ; ./configure --with-adobe ; make

The following command works:
$ bin/exiv2 http://clanmills.com/Stonehenge.jpg is working

On 2017-08-15 The following command crashes when it attempts to execute XMPsdk code
$ bin/exiv2 --verbose --version

This is correct. libXMPCore.a is not in the mix.

$ nm -g xmpsdk/Adobe/libXMPCore.a | grep _ZNSiD0Ev
                 U __ZNSiD0Ev
$

Adobe XMPSDK 2014 has a similar problem with __ZNSs4_Rep11_S_terminalE

$ c++filt __ZNSs4_Rep11_S_terminalE

2.3 Notes (mostly to remind me of painful discoveries)
------------------------------------------------------

How does the build get generated?
$ make config
This generates ./configure by reading config/configure.ac

When you use --with-adobe, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS are modified and ENABLE_XMP is set to 2016.
Makefile has code to execute the script xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.sh which
downloads and builds the XMPsdk to create libCore.a (which we need) and libFiles.a

config/config.mk.in is converted into config/config.mk and included in xmpsdk/src/Makefile
This is really ugly.  config.mk also messes with CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS

To get -lXMPCore into the mix, set XMPSDK_LIBS in config/config.mk.in
        XMPSDK_LIBS     = -lXMPCore

508 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/gnu/github/exiv2 $ finder Makefile | xargs grep -H config.mk | grep include

==========================================================================

3   Features to Add to the CMake code

  * Auto usage of ccache on Linux and Mac.
  * Remove the trick to compile the documentation using the configure script. Native documentation generation on CMake.

==========================================================================

4   Build design for v0.26.1

Added   : 2017-08-18
Modified: 2017-08-23

    The purpose of the v0.26.1 is to release bug fixes and
    experimental new features which may become defaults with v0.27

4.1 Backwards compatibility
    This feature is being added to v0.26.1 DOT release and therefore existing
    behaviour of ./configure, CMake and msvc does not change.

    ./configure --enable-xmp (default is true) will build a library libxmpsdk.a
    using the code in xmpsdk/src.  This library is linked into libexiv2.26.dylib

4.2 New Options for ./configure

    ./configure --with-std=c++11
        The default behaviour is the same as v0.26.0 --with-std=-std=c++98
        If the user requests --with-adobe, --with-std=c++11 is the default

    ./configure --with-adobe[=2016|2014]
        This causes the Adobe XMPsdk to be downloaded and built
        into the directory xmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607/libXMPCore.a

        The dynamic library libexiv2.26.dylib will not have libXMPCore.a linked
        All applications (such as exiv2, exifprint etc) will require:
          -Lxmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607 -lXMPCore

        This is an important architectural change in libexiv2.26.dylib
        However this is the way to achieve architecture independence between
        exiv2 and Adobe XMPsdk.  A longer term goal is to totally remove
        all Adobe code from the exiv2 tarball.

        Although --with-adobe causes the default compiler to be --with-std=c++11,
        the code will with --with-std=c++98  The Adobe XMPsdk is built using the script
        xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk which downloads and builds libXMPCore.a using Adobe provided
        CMake code.  For the 2016 SDK, libXMPCore.a is built with -std=c++11

4.3 New Options for msvc
    This work has not been started.  There are at least two possibilities:

    1) To provide a new solution msvc/exiv2-adobe.sln
       This is the model used by msvc/exiv2-webready.sln
    2) To update msvc/configure.py to support options similar to
       ./configure --with-std= and ./config --with-adobe

4.4 New Options for CMake
    Luis is adopting a two stage approach:

    1) Cleaning up and refactoring the existing CMake scripts (*.cmake and CMakeLists.txt files)
       This work is proceeding well.
    2) Adding new EXIV2_ENABLE_XXXXs equivalent  to ./configure --with-std and --with-adobe
       This work is waiting for Robin to complete the ./configure modifications.

    It is expected that the CMake files will execute the script xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.{sh|cmd}
    to perform the build of libXMPCore.a

4.5 New Options for contrib/cmake/msvc
    To be written.  Luis' great new work may make this obsolete.

4.6 Scripts xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.sh and xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.cmd

    These scripts download and build the Adobe XMPsdk.  Minor modification of the SDK
    is necessary to enable the code to build.  For example, Adobe does not support Cygwin
    and minor change are necessary to build on that platform.

    Changes to Adobe code will be minimal and documented in xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.{sh|cmd}

4.7 Support for 32/64 bit builds, Release/Debug, Shared/Static

    1) v0.26.1 will build exactly as v0.26 and support linking static libxmpsdk.a
       32/64 static/shared debug/release are supported on all platforms

    2) The new features (--with-std and --with-adobe) will only be supported for
       a static/release build of libXMPCore.a
       msvc will continue to supports 32/64 ReleaseDLL/Release/DebugDLL/Debug of libexiv2
       which will include the static libXMPCore.a or libxmpsdk.a

4.8 Support for MinGW
    MinGW msys/1.0 was deprecated when v0.26 was released.
    No support for MinGW msys/1.0 will be provided.
    It's very likely that the MinGW msys/1.0 will build.
    I will not provide any user support for MinGW msys/1.0 in future.

    MinGW msys/2.0 might be supported as "experimental" in Exiv2 v0.26.2

4.9 Building and linking XMPsdk with libexiv2

    Exiv2 v0.26 (and many earlier editions) contain Adobe XMPsdk code.
    The precise version of this code is unknown.
    The xmpsdk/ directory has files in src/*.cpp and include/*.hpp
    The xmpsdk/ has its own Makefile, CMakeLists.txt and msvc/xmpsdk/project files.

    Exiv2 v0.26 builds a static library libxmpsdk.a which is linked into libexiv2.a

    None of this will change in Exiv2 v0.26.1

    Exiv2 v0.26.1 will support a new option to download and build "pure Adobe" XMPsdk.
    Three flavours will be supported:
        2013  http://download.macromedia.com/pub/developer/xmp/sdk/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC-201306.zip
        2014  http://download.macromedia.com/pub/developer/xmp/sdk/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201412.zip
        2016  http://download.macromedia.com/pub/developer/xmp/sdk/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607.zip
    As Adobe appear to release new editions every 18 months, I guess that Adobe will release
    a new version in Spring 2018.

    The autotools build supports new ./configure options:
        --with-adobe        builds and links 4089256 Aug 23 11:19 ./xmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201306/libXMPCore.a
        --with-adobe=2016   as --with-adobe
        --with-adobe=2014                    4108792 Aug 23 11:18 ./xmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201412/libXMPCore.a
        --with-adobe=2013                   22242448 Aug 23 10:25 ./xmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607/libXMPCore.a

    The build of the Adobe XMPsdk is "pure Adobe".  We download the code and build it without modification.

    The scripts to download and build the Adobe code is:
        xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.sh
        xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.cmd

    Adobe build the 2016 SDK with -std=c++11.  This links successfully with the libexiv2 -std=c++98 build.
    I haven't investigated which compiler Adobe use to build the 2013 and 2014 editions.

    Mac Build
    Following the analysis of Adobe's build (Topics 1 and 2 in this report), it has been realised that:
    1 Adobe build the SDK with (both linker and compiler) -stdlib=libstdc++
    2 Visibility should be disabled in the compiler

    CPPFLAGS   = -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -std=c++98 -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden \
                 -stdlib=libstdc++ -Wno-deprecated    -Ixmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607/public/include
    LDFLAGS    = -L/usr/local/lib -lpthread -stdlib=libstdc++ -Wno-deprecated  -Lxmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607
    LIBS       = -lz -lXMPCore
    CXX        = g++

    Linux Build
    CPPFLAGS   = -I/usr/local/include -std=c++98   -Ixmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607/public/include
    LDFLAGS    = -L/usr/local/lib -ldl -lpthread   -Lxmpsdk/Adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK-CC201607
    LIBS       = -lz  -lm -lXMPCore
    CXX        = g++

    When 2013 or 2014 are selected, the appropriate -Ipath and -Lpath should be set.

    CMake Build
    A new option -DEXIV2_ENABLE_ADOBE[=2016|=2014|=2013] should be added.
    The build of XMPsdk should be performed with xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.sh (or xmpsdk/buildXMPsdk.cmd for Visual Studio)
    The build should set same LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS as the autotools build.

    When the options -DEXIV2_ENABLE_ADOBE is not used, we should compile the code in xmpsdk/src
    to create and link libxmpsdk.a

5   Refactoring the Tiff Code

Added   : 2017-09-24
Modified: 2017-09-24

5.1 Background
    Tiff parsing is the root code of a metadata engine.

    The Tiff parsing code in Exiv2 is very difficult to understand and has major architectural shortcomings:

    1) It requires the Tiff file to be totally in memory
    2) It cannot handle BigTiff
    3) The parser doesn't know the source of the in memory tiff image
    4) It uses memory mapping on the tiff file
       - if the network connection is lost, horrible things happen
       - it requires a lot of VM to map the complete file
       - BigTiff file can be 100GB+
       - The memory mapping causes problems with Virus Detection software on Windows
    5) The parser cannot deal with multi-page tiff files
    6) It requires the total file to be in contiguous memory and defeats 'webready'.

    The Tiff parsing code in Exiv2 is ingenious.  It's also very robust.  It works well.  It can:

    1) Handle 32-bit Tiff and Many Raw formats (which are derived from Tiff)
    2) It can read and write Manufacturer's MakerNotes which are (mostly) in Tiff format
    3) It probably has other great features that I haven't discovered
       - because the code is so hard to understand, I can't simply browse and read it.
    4) It separates file navigation from data analysis.

    The code in image::printStructure was originally written to understand "what is a tiff?"
    It has problems:
    1) It was intended to be a single threaded debugging function and has security issues.
    2) It doesn't handle BigTiff
    3) It's messy.  It's reading and processing metadata simultaneously.

    The aim of this project is to
    1) Reconsider the Tiff Code.
    2) Keep everything good in the code and address known deficiencies
    3) Establish a Team Exiv2 "Tiff Expert" who knows the code intimately.

5.2 How does Exiv2 decode the ExifData in a JPEG?
    You can get my test file from http://clanmills.com/Stonehenge.jpg

    Exiv2 calls JpegBase::readMetadata which locates the APP1/Exif segment.
    It invokes the ExifParser:
       ExifParser::decode(exifData_, rawExif.pData_, rawExif.size_);
    This is thin wrapper over:
       TiffParserWorker::decode(....) in tiffimage.cpp

    What happens then?  I don't know.  The metadata is decoded in:
       tiffvisitor.cpp TiffDecoder::visitEntry()

    The design of the TiffMumble classes is the "Visitor" pattern
    described in "Design Patterns" by Addison & Wesley.  The aim of the pattern
    is to separate parsing from dealing with the data.

    The data is being stored in ExifData which is a vector.
    Order is important and preserved.
    As the data values are recovered they are stored as Exifdatum in the vector.

    How does the tiff visitor work?  I think the reader and processor
    are connected by this line in TiffParser::
        rootDir->accept(reader);

    The class tree for the decoder is:

    class TiffDecoder : public TiffFinder {
      class TiffReader ,
      class TiffFinder : public TiffVisitor {
        class TiffVisitor {
          public:
          //! Events for the stop/go flag. See setGo().
          enum GoEvent {
              geTraverse       = 0,
              geKnownMakernote = 1
          };

          void setGo(GoEvent event, bool go);
          virtual void visitEntry(TiffEntry* object) =0;
          virtual void visitDataEntry(TiffDataEntry* object) =0;
          virtual void visitImageEntry(TiffImageEntry* object) =0;
          virtual void visitSizeEntry(TiffSizeEntry* object) =0;
          virtual void visitDirectory(TiffDirectory* object) =0;
          virtual void visitSubIfd(TiffSubIfd* object) =0;
          virtual void visitMnEntry(TiffMnEntry* object) =0;
          virtual void visitIfdMakernote(TiffIfdMakernote* object) =0;
          virtual void visitIfdMakernoteEnd(TiffIfdMakernote* object);
          virtual void visitBinaryArray(TiffBinaryArray* object) =0;
          virtual void visitBinaryArrayEnd(TiffBinaryArray* object);
          //! Operation to perform for an element of a binary array
          virtual void visitBinaryElement(TiffBinaryElement* object) =0;

          //! Check if stop flag for \em event is clear, return true if it's clear.
          bool go(GoEvent event) const;
        }
      }
    }

    The reader works by stepping along the Tiff directory and calls the visitor's
    "callbacks" as it reads.

    There are 2000 lines of code in tiffcomposite.cpp and, to be honest,
    I don't know what most of it does!

    Set a breakpoint in src/exif.cpp#571.
    That’s where he adds the key/value to the exifData vector.
    Exactly how did he get here?  That’s a puzzle.

    void ExifData::add(const ExifKey& key, const Value* pValue)
    {
        add(Exifdatum(key, pValue));
    }

    The MakerNote decodes them into:

    Exif.Nikon1, Exiv2.NikonAf2 and so on.  I don't know exactly it achieves this.
    However it means that tag-numbers can be reused in different IFDs.
    Tag 0x0016 = Nikon GPSSpeed and can mean something different elsewhere.

5.4 Where are the tags defined?

    There's an array of "TagInfo" data structures in each of the makernote decoders.
    These define the tag (a number) and the tag name, the groupID (eg canonId) and the default type.
    There's also a callback to print the value of the tag.  This does the "interpretation"
    that is performed by the -pt in the exiv2 command-line program.

    TagInfo(0x4001, "ColorData", N_("Color Data"), N_("Color data"), canonId, makerTags, unsignedShort, -1, printValue),

5.5 How do the MakerNotes get decoded?

    I don't know.  It has something to do with this code in tiffcomposite.cpp#936

    TiffMnEntry::doAccept(TiffVisitor& visitor) { ... }

    Most makernotes are TiffStructures.  So the TiffXXX classes are invoked recursively to decode the maker note.

5.6 How do the encoders work?

    I understand writeMetadata() and will document that soon.
    I still have to study how the TiffVisitor writes metadata.


6   Using external XMP SDK via Conan

Section 1 describes how to compile the newer versions of XMP SDK with a bash script. This
approach had few limitations:

    1) We had to include sources from other projects into the Exiv2 repository: Check the folder
    xmpsdk/third-party.
    2) Different scripts for compiling XMP SDK on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.
    3) Lot of configuration/compilation issues depending on the system configuration.

Taking into account that during the last months we have done a big effort in migrating the
manipulation of 3rd party dependencies to Conan, we have decided to do the same here. A conan recipe
has been written for XmpSdk at:

https://github.com/piponazo/conan-xmpsdk

And the recipe and package binaries can be found in the piponazo's bintray repository:

https://bintray.com/piponazo/piponazo

This conan recipe provides a custom CMake finder that will be used by our CMake code to properly
find XMP SDK in the conan cache and then be able to use the CMake variables: ${XMPSDK_LIBRARY} and
${XMPSDK_INCLUDE_DIR}.

These are the steps you will need to follow to configure the project with the external XMP support:

    # Add the conan-piponazo remote to your conan configuration (only once)

    # Run conan to bring the dependencies. Note that the XMPSDK is not enabled by default and you will
    # need to enable the xmp option to bring it.
    conan install .. --options xmp=True

    # Configure the project with support for the external XMP version. Disable the normal XMP version
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEXIV2_ENABLE_XMP=OFF -DEXIV2_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_XMP=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..

Note that the usage of the newer versions of XMP is experimental and it was included in Exiv2
because few users has requested it.
