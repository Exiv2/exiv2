Detailed Change List since 0.27.3
---------------------------------

https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/1018#issuecomment-757979745

Future Releases
---------------

We have about 8 regular contributors.
About 100 folks have contributed since 2004.
We will always welcome new contributors to work on any aspect of the code and projects.

I celebrated my 70th birthday in January and want to retire.

The project status is tracked here: https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/1462

Exiv2 v0.27.4 is likely to be the final "dot" of the Exiv2 v0.27 product family.

Development will now move to branch 'main'.

We plan to port the unique_ptr from branch 'old-master' and ship 'main' as v1.00 in December 2021.
