	- 0000427: [misc] Standardized factories according to the implementation.
	           of ImageFactory (MakerNoteFactory). Linking with mn.o is not
	           necessary anymore.
	- 0000420: [build environment] Defines should have a library specific
	           prefix, like e.g., EXV_HAVE_CONFIG_H.
	- 0000417: [exif] ExifData needs proper copy constructor and assignment.
	- 0000426: [iptc] Fixed problem which prevented Exiv2 from reading IPTC
	           from jpeg files. (Jeffrey J. Early and others)
	         - [feature] Added Olympus, Panasonic and a basic Sony Makernote.
	           (Thanks to Will Stokes for the initial Olympus files)
	         - [feature] Improved Canon and Nikon Makernote support.
	           (Thanks to Robert Rottmerhusen for his Nikon lens info)
	         - [exif] Relaxed checking of Makernote IFD next pointer.
	         - [design] Overhauled exception handling.


Changes from version 0.6.1 to 0.6.2
-----------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility
	         - [feature] New -M option to run modification commands directly
	            from the command line.
	- 0000421: [tools] Command parser fails if no type is specified with a
	           modify command.
	- 0000416: [exif] Fix Exiv2 modify action to use non-intrusive writing
	           whenever possible.
	- 0000418: [feature] Add Exiv2 option to specify path of extracted.
	           and inserted files. (Suggested by Brian Pugh)

* Exiv2 library
	- 0000408: [build environment] 0.6.1 does not build on OS X: Add libtool
	           support for automatic library creation (see README).
	           (Reported by Thomas Lunde and others)
	- 0000409: [build environment] compiling emits type warnings. (Thomas Lunde
	           and others)
	- 0000410: [build environment] config.h must be installed, -DHAVE_CONFIG_H
	           flag should not be necessary. (Daniel Foote and others)
	- 0000411: [exif] Support non-standard Ifd layout. (Jeffrey J. Early)


Changes from version 0.6 to 0.6.1
---------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added option to modify Iptc and Exif metadata based on a command file

* Exiv2 library

	* Fixed bug #407: Writing metadata to image after modifications may
	  lose thumbnail. Thanks to Jeffrey J. Early for pointing out this bug.

	* Added CommentValue


Changes from version 0.5 to 0.6
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added options to extract, insert and delete different types of metadata

	* Added option to print the Jpeg comment

	* Changed semantics of print option `i' to Iptc
	  (`t' for translated Exif data)

	* Replaced std::cout << "\n" with std::endl to flush and get the
	  sequence with error output right

* Exiv2 library

	* Added support to build Makernotes from scratch

	* Added support to build IFD1 (Thumbnail) entries from scratch

	* Open image files on demand rather than keeping them open. Bug #393 (Brad)

	* Added data area concept to Value, ValueType, Entry, Ifd. Feature #395

	* Revamped Thumbnail classes to use the new data area feature. Feature #398

	* Added ExifData::setJpegThumbnail

	* Improved implementation of Exif and Iptc keys, added support for
	  keys with unknown tag names

	* Added ExifData::op[] and Exifdatum op= and similar operators to
	  IptcData and Iptcdatum. This operator stuff allows for things like:
	  exifData["Exif.Thumbnail.Compression"] = uint16_t(6);

	* Converted class hierarchies to use std::auto_ptr where appropriate

	* Replaced custom integer types with C99 types

	* Added test data and drivers to the repository

	* Right align output stream for date and time writes. Bug #397 (Brad)

	* Updated documentation

* MSVC related (Thanks to Brad Schick)

	* Added exivsimple: a Windows dll that allows languages such as
	  C# and VB to access limited metadata capabilities (Brad)

	* Added and write2-test projects to MSVC build (Brad)

	* Added mn.cpp to all MSVC projects. Fixes bug #396 (Brad)

	* Fixed various MSVC 7.1 build errors. Bug #394 (Brad)

	* Added write-test to MSVC build project (Brad)


Changes from version 0.4 to 0.5
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Added -pI print mode to print Iptc data.

	* Bugfix: Use timegm() and gmtime() instead of mktime() and
	  localtime() to avoid problems when adjusting timestamps.
	  Thanks to Samir Rostum for pointing out this bug.

	* Added timegm() from the tz distribution for platforms which
	  do not have this function.

* Exiv2 library

	* Added full Iptc read and write support. Thanks to Brad Schick for
	  this and a lot more contributions to this release.

	* Converted Metadatum to an abstract base class, added Exifdatum
	  and Iptcdatum classes. Migration of existing programs: Use class
	  Exifdatum instead of Metadatum. (Brad Schick)

	* Added Key, ExifKey and IptcKey class hierarchy. Requires changes
	  to existing pograms: Use class ExifKey where plain std::string
	  keys were used before (e.g., ExifData::findKey()).

	* Changed Exif keys to 'Exif.ifdItem.tagName' to be consistent
	  with the new Iptc keys. All keys of existing programs need to be
	  updated. See the web pages or documentation for the new keys.

	* Revamped class Image and introduced byte* interface. (Brad Schick)

	* Added autoconf configure script.

	* Added MSVC project files. (Brad Schick)

	* Appended 'Id' to Ifd ids to work around a g++-3.4 problem.

	* Updated documentation.


Changes from version 0.3 to 0.4
-------------------------------

* Exiv2 utility

	* Less rigid command line argument parsing: Guess the action from the
	  option given and use print as the default action.

	* Print Nikon makernote values for ISO Speed, Quality and WhiteBalance
	  in the summary.

* Exiv2 library

	* Fixed ExifData::copyFromMetadata to automatically add missing
	  offset tags. Thanks to Joseph Heled for identifying this bug.

	* Started to fix MSVC errors and warnings. Thanks to Steven R. King for
	  his work to get Exiv2 to compile on MSVC. The task is not yet
	  completed but the library should compile without too many warnings.

	* Added three different Nikon makernote formats.

	* IfdMakerNote: Replaced too simple prefix with a more general concept
	  of a makernote header.

	* Added the makernote buffer to the arguments passed to the makernote
	  create function. This allows the makernote create function to
	  determine the exact makernote needed based on its content. The new
	  concept is used to automatically determine which of the three Nikon
	  makernotes to create.

	* Fixed MakerNoteFactory::match() to prefer an exact match over a
	  wildcard match with the same number of matching characters (Key
	  "Nikon" now prefers registry entry "Nikon" over "Nikon*"), simplified
	  the return value of match() to an integer score value.

	* Sigma makernote: Added "FOVEON" and "*" to registry.

	* Added len argument and boundary checks to various read functions,
	  in particular, the IFD read method.

	* Improved handling of corrupt IFDs: Truncate field if offset points
	  outside of the available buffer.

	* Slightly improved error handling: strError() is now a static member
	  of ExifData.

	* Added exifcomment example program.

	* Fixed an embarrassing bug in ExifData::updateEntries, which caused
	  write after erasing metadata to write back the original metadata.

	* Fixed TypeInfoTable to return invalid if typeId is too large.

	* Makefile: (un)install targets now only (un)install exiv2.

	* Code cleanup, documentation updates and miscellaneous bug fixes.
