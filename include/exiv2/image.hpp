    @brief Determine if the content of \em io is an image of \em type.

    The \em advance flag determines if the read position in the
    stream is moved (see below). This applies only if the type
    matches and the function returns true. If the type does not
    match, the stream position is not changed. However, if
    reading from the stream fails, the stream position is
    undefined. Consult the stream state to obtain more
    information in this case.

    @param type Type of the image.
    @param io BasicIo instance to read from.
    @param advance Flag indicating whether the position of the io
        should be advanced by the number of characters read to
        analyse the data (true) or left at its original
        position (false). This applies only if the type matches.
    @return  true  if the data matches the type of this class;<BR>
             false if the data does not match
