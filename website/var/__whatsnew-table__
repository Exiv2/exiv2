  <h3>Goals and Project Plans for v0.27</h3>
  <p>We welcome Ben, Raphael, Shridar and Troy to Team Exiv2. We hope Alan, Andreas, Alan, Thomas, Mahesh, Gilles and Niels will continue to contribute.</p>
  <p>It is intended to update the specification for Exiv2 v0.27 in consultation with Team Exiv2.
     <br>Specification and progress reports: <a href="http://dev.exiv2.org/news/3">http://dev.exiv2.org/news/3</a>

   now). As a result, the C++ interface changed fundamentally in the
   way how metadata is accessed. Existing programs will need to be
   updated (see the examples). Thanks to the new I/O abstraction layer,
   it is now possible to access images in memory directly.<br>
   Additional makernotes from Olympus, Panasonic and Sony cameras
   are recognized and the Canon and Nikon makernotes have been updated.<br>
   Exif tags now have a default type, it works like the existing Iptc
   default type.<br>

<b><a name="item42">Exiv2 0.6 released</a></b><br>This is a maintenance release containing numerous smaller
   improvements and fixes. The Exiv2 utility now also deletes,
   extracts, and re-inserts IPTC data and Jpeg comments from/into Jpeg
   files. The library now supports creation of all Exif metadata from
   scratch, including makernote tags and thumbnails. In addition, Exif
   as well as IPTC metadata with unknown tag names can be added and
   manipulated just like known tags. See the <a title="Changelog" href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for more details.

<b><a name="item44">Exiv2 0.5 released</a></b><br>This release adds support for IPTC metadata. IPTC datasets can
   now be manipulated (read and written) similar to Exif metadata.
   In connection with the IPTC feature, the existing Metadatum Key and
   Value concept was enhanced and the Jpeg file access code was revamped.
   The exiv2 utility has a new print option to show the IPTC metadata of
   a Jpeg image.
   Also, this release adds a configure script and MSVC project files
   (but no libtool support yet).

<b><a name="item45">Exif keys changed</a></b><br>Starting with release 0.5 the keys used to identify
   <a title="Exif and MakerNote tags" href="metadata.html">Exif tags</a>
   are of the form '<i>Exif</i>.groupName.tagName' to be consistent
   with the new IPTC keys. Existing programs need to be updated
   accordingly. Since the old keys are plain C++ strings, the
   compiler cannot detect the change. However, it will tell you to use
   the new classes Key and ExifKey in the critical regions of the code.

<b><a name="item46">Exiv2 0.4 released</a></b><br>This release adds support for three different Nikon makernote
   formats to the library. The generalised IfdMakerNote interface can
   accomodate more makernote oddities and allows for programmatic
   detection of the makernote format. The library now knows how to
   deal with broken IFDs. The Exiv2 utility uses a more intuitive and
   less rigid command line parsing logic. See the <a title="Changelog" href="changelog.html">changelog</a>
